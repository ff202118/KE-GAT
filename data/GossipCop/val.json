[{"title": "France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery", "text": "\n\nPlastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in France. (Bertrand Combaldieu/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.\n\nThe new law is a part of the country\u2019s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries \u2014 including in some U.S. states \u2014 no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France\u2019s will be.\n\nThe general idea behind the law \u2014 following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming \u2014 is to promote a \u201ccircular economy\u201d of waste disposal, \u201cfrom product design to recycling,\u201d French lawmakers say.\n\n[A Maryland county\u2019s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]\n\nObjections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.\n\nIn the words of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended \u201cto make France \u2026 an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources\u201d -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.\n\nNot all share the enthusiasm of France\u2019s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.\n\nEamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cWe are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, we will.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an \u201canti-social\u201d provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.\n\nThe ban was then postponed until 2020.", "label": "real"},

{"title": "How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward", "text": "Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.\n\nBut lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.\n\nTrump is saying \u201cyes\u201d to Fox News almost every day but saying \u201cno\u201d to most other major networks and news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday morning, he is booked on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate\u2019s exposure to hard-hitting questions \u2014 while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nAt Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won\u2019t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn\u2019t challenged \u2013 and that\u2019s the way he wants it.\n\nThe problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn\u2019t reaching out.\n\nIt is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in \u201cswing\u201d districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.\n\nOn election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney \u201clandslide\u201d the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.\n\nFeatured image via Flickr", "label": "real"},

No other candidates qualified.\n\nWho will moderate the debate?\n\nLester Holt, who anchors \"NBC Nightly News,\" will be the moderator. It\u2019s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.\n\nWhat is the format of the debate?\n\nThe debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: \u201cAmerica's direction,\u201d \u201cachieving prosperity,\u201d and \u201csecuring America.\u201d The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.\n\nWhy aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?\n\nLibertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.\n\nWhat's at stake for Hillary Clinton?\n\nThe debate is Clinton\u2019s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton\u2019s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump\u2019s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.\n\nWhat's at stake for Donald Trump?\n\nTrump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint \u2014 provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected \u2014 could help him clear the low bar again.\n\nWhat is the most watched debate in presidential history?\n\nIn 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976.

He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,\" federal prosecutors wrote. \"While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.\"\n\nThe writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.\n\nDefense lawyers contend that Rahami has been \"without the benefit of counsel\" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.\n\nWhile Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the \"near future,\" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.\n\nThe letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's \"plainly premature\" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.\n\nCourt records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.\n\nJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.\n\nAuthors:", "label": "real"},

{"title": "Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible'", "text": "Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge \"as bad as possible,\" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.\n\nDavid Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.\n\nWildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a \"Democrat in a Democratic town\" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to \"alienate anyone.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" Wildstein responded.\n\nA phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.\n\n\"I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,\" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.\n\nWildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.\n\nWildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.\n\nThis \"radio silence\" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.\n\nWildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to \"maximize the impact on Fort Lee.\" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.\n\nBaroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, \"Fantastic,\" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.\n\nWildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause \"sideswipe crashes,\" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.\n\nOn Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.\n\nBob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a \"mess.\"\n\nWildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.\n\n\"I told him not to say anything to anybody,\" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.\n\nWildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get \"some numbers\" on the traffic patterns.\n\nWildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton \"yes,\" but that this was a lie.\n\nAll of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.\n\nOn the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.\n\n\"I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,\" Wildstein testified.\n\nA Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.\n\nWildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and \"she was pleased.\"\n\nSeveral calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of \"radio silence\" was put into effect and no messages were returned.\n\nLast week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.\n\nWildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, \"the one constituent rule.\" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the \"one constituent rule\" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.\n\nKelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.", "label": "real"},

But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump\u2019s tax returns as well as other things.\n\nLook at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.\n\n521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton\u2019s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.\n\nRegardless of these apparent \u201cwinning\u201d results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.\n\nWith the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds.

Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying \u2013 and that the shot came from law enforcement.\n\nOne key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight.

The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. \u2014 BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let\u2019s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n\u201cThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,\u201d Meyer told me almost breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter leaving \u2018The Epicenter,\u2019 police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful \u2013 and that\u2019s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\u201d\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, \u201coh, absolutely.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gunshot,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt was much louder.

At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn\u2019t already left, exited.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was \u2018entirely too loud for a gunshot too.

He\u2019s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he\u2019s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia\u201d he tweeted in July. Now \u2013 brace yourself, this might come as a shock \u2013 it appears he\u2019s been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has \u201cnumerous ties\u201d to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. \u201cThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate\u2014[and] be associated with Donald Trump\u201d says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to \u201clarge numbers\u201d of Russian buyers \u2013 so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense \u2013 they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\n\u201cI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption\u2026They don\u2019t read books. They don\u2019t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht\u201d says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as \u201ccultural ignoramuses\u2026not interested in social justice.\u201d Sound like anyone we know?\n\nWhen the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves \u2013 and Trump himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that, yeah we\u2019ll be looking\u201d said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.\n\nThese business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it\u2019s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.\n\nWatch ABC News\u2019 report here:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

{"title": "Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony", "text": "11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because \u201che would\u2019ve gotten it, if I wanted it.\u201d But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul \u2013 this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\n\nOne of these stories is a lie\u2014a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump\u2019s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn\u2019t want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush\u2019s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies\u2014he had played the \u201ccash for outcomes\u201d political game for years\u2014he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush\u2019s opposition\u2014if Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would\u2019ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump\u2019s na\u00efve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald\u2019s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn\u2019t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple\u2014Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater \u201cscandal\u201d for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump\u2019s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party\u2019s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it\u2019s head.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it\u2019s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there\u2019s no third option here:\n\nBush: \u201cThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something\u2014that was generous and gave me money\u2014was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.\u201d Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn\u2019t\u2014 Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn\u2019t get it, because I was opposed to\u2014 Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before\u2014 Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I\u2019m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, \u201cDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?\u201d Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush\u2026and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn\u2019t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn\u2019t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

{"title": "Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning", "text": "Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nLast year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, \"especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year.\" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015\r\n\r\nThe story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.\r\n\r\nAccording to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's \"rigorous fact-checking\" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the \"birther moment\" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.\r\n\r\nSo, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.", "label": "fake"},

{"title": "Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination", "text": "13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nS Trump\u2019s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity. I\u2019m proud to be gay, I\u2019m proud to be a Republican,\u201d after a lengthy rant against \u201cgovernment incompetence.\u201d He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn\u2019t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,\u201d said the Department of Labor\u2019s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. \u201cOur nation\u2019s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.\u201d Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer \u2013 the federal government \u2013 of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company\u2019s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed \u201cwatered down\u201d drugs to third-world countries.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u2014 The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. \u2014 The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u2014 The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nThis latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!\n\nDo you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world?

{"title": "Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona", "text": "According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don\u2019t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.\n\nCase in point.\n\nThe specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child\u2019s genitals, so if you\u2019re a parent of a child and you\u2019ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you\u2019re a felon. For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from \u201cintentionally or knowingly touching\u201d the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don\u2019t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that \u201cprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.\u201d They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, y\u2019all. There\u2019s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here\u2019s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority\u2019s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state\u2019s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona\u2019s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y\u2019all. Because doesn\u2019t government always know best?", "label": "fake"},

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2013 literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\n\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201d\n\nThis method was developed by the KGB, which became the FSB following the fall of the USSR.\n\nWhat we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for Donald Trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by Russian agents from the FSB (formerly the KGB).\n\n\u201cIf people were not beholden to Russia, they would have voted for Hillary Clinton,\u201d a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by CrowdStrike, a contractor hired by the DNC to investigate Russian space-beam mind control.\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the response from Peskov \u201cpredictable,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat do you expect from the criminal Putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the Ukraine, murdered innocent Syrians and hacked our elections by controlling people\u2019s brains with a space-beam?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million American voters are working directly for Russia, Senator John McCain has called for mass arrests.

We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.\n\nWhat he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201cYou have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\u201d\n\nWHEELER: \"For sure...\"\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201c...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\"\n\nWHEELER: \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"\n\nIn the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.\n\nSince Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as \"miscommunication.\"\n\nWhen asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.\n\nWe reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, \"The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal story:\n\nIt has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all.

We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it\u2019s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you\u2019re prepared for.\n\nNASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u201cRest Studies\u201d \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.\n\nSo what is the exact purpose of these studies?\n\nThese studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.\n\nThe Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.\n\nThis study is designed to achieve three core tasks:\n\nExamining how the astronauts\u2019 changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.\n\nExamining if the astronauts\u2019 physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.\n\nPreparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.\n\nThe study\u2019s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.\n\nThe exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you\u2019re in the exercising or non-exercising group.\n\nOnce the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you\u2019ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you\u2019ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You\u2019ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.\n\nDuring the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s immunity system.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nYou may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.\n\nThis will probably be your only opportunity to say that you\u2019ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.", "label": "fake"},
{"title": "COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY", "text": "HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It\u2019s NOT PRETTY \u2026 FOR THEM\n\n\u201cThe tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d \u2013 Thomas Jefferson\n\nELDER PATRIOT \u2013 Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson\u2019s directive to their own detriment. It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.\n\nAmericans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.\n\nConservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.\n\nCruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201d\n\nCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201d\n\nAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201d\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\n\u201cImpeach!\u201d It\u2019s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word \u2013 long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the \u201cI\u201d word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked \u201cWatergate.\u201d\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left\u2019s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America\u2019s new Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,\u201d says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. \u201cNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I\u2019m not going to stop asking them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans\u2019 tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. \u2026 Resign now.\u201d\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned \u201cimpeachment\u201d enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, there\u2019s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\n\u201cThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,\u201d Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless \u201cgotcha\u201d announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence \u201ccorruptly\u201d when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted \u201cwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.\u201d Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws.

He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIA\u2019s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.\n\nIn 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.\n\nAll of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.\n\nHe currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n\u201cI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA\u2019s payroll,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201d\n\nSnowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him?

There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.\r\nAccording to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus\u2019 bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.\r\nOnce the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun\u2019s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event.

{"title": "McConnell plays hardball in spending fight", "text": "Sen. Mitch McConnell said a filed spending measure is the \"result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\" | Getty McConnell plays hardball in spending fight\n\nMitch McConnell is playing hardball \u2014 forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.\n\nWith spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats \u2014 yet still isn\u2019t enough to get the minority party on board.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.\n\nThe new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday \u2014 which funds the government until Dec. 9 \u2014 also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.\n\n\u201cThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve just offered,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn\u2019t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\n\u201cTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. \"I haven\u2019t counted votes but our caucus isn\u2019t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.\"\n\nIt also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank\u2019s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn\u2019t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.\n\nYet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika \"with no political riders.\"\n\n\"While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,\" Nelson said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,\u201d Reid told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she\u2019s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It\u2019s really unfair to the American people.\u201d\n\nDuring her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, \u201cin my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.\u201d\n\nMaryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a \u201cRepublican-only bill\" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want \"low drama\" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.\n\n\"I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.\"\n\nHeather Caygle, Louis Nelson, Burgess Everett and Ashley Gold contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "label": "real"},

{"title": "Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service", "text": "Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s standard practice for the agency \u2014 which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials \u2014 to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.\n\nThe difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,\" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. \"It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying \u201ceverything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.\u201d\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC \u201cspecifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats\u201d on charter aircraft.\n\nA POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump\u2019s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.\n\nBut the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.\n\nTrump, who once said \u201cI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,\u201d has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.\n\nThe campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as \u201cmisleading and flat out wrong,\u201d pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.\n\nThe statement explained the campaign\u2019s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying \u201cthe campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\"It's basically just calling it even,\" Engle said. \"It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.\"\n\nThe same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it\u2019s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.\n\nThe Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.\n\nThe agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.\n\nOf course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump\u2019s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.\n\n\n\nAuthors:", "label": "real"},

Chuck Schumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he\u2019s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on Tuesday. He\u2019s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\n\u201cThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to allocate our resources so they\u2019re meaningful to us and our candidates.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumer\u2019s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party\u2019s candidates and a reflection of Democrats\u2019 future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates\u2019 committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He\u2019s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that\u2019s projected to bring in \u201cupwards of another million,\u201d according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\n\u201cSchumer has been relentless,\u201d said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\n\u201cLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,\u201d McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer\u2019s colleagues won\u2019t rule out the possibility that he\u2019ll donate more to his party\u2019s Senate takeover effort.\n\n\u201cIf he thinks it will make a difference, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019s very calculating,\u201d said a Democratic senator. \u201cChuck will be there if you need him.\u201d\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to watch everything closely. It\u2019s my sense he\u2019s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,\u201d Stabenow said.\n\nThere\u2019s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some tough decisions, which haven\u2019t been made yet,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he\u2019ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,\u201d Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply don\u2019t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner.

{"title": "America's relationships are on the line \u2014 no matter who wins", "text": "NEW YORK \u2013 All politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top Democrats and Republicans fear that will reshape America\u2019s relationships around the world no matter who wins.\n\nThis week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2014a clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. She\u2019ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea.\n\nClinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2014an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she\u2019s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump\u2019s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt\u2019s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America.\n\nKeeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama\u2019s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator.\n\nBut none of this compares to the degree to which this year\u2019s race is defined by global affairs \u2013 the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy.\n\nClinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn\u2019t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very concerned,\u201d said a Clinton aide. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he\u2019s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nCertainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water\u2019s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIt will have lasting impact,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee\n\n\u201cIt has been changed,\u201d agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. \u201cIt gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.\u201d\n\nThere has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump\u2019s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico\u2019s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America\u2019s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that\u2019s hardly all.\n\nThere was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he\u2019s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.\n\nAnd just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of \u201cplaying into the hands\u201d of ISIL.\n\nOfficials openly wonder what Clinton\u2019s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?\n\nWhile many in Washington\u2019s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.\n\nHer meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they\u2019re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail.\n\nTake Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump\u2019s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it\u2019s important from a policy standpoint,\u201d the aide said.\n\nIf Trump wins, he\u2019ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.\n\n\u201cThey will certainly want to see where we\u2019re coming from,\u201d King said. \u201cHe will have to clarify and make it clear where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nIf Clinton wins, she\u2019ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush.\n\nCardin, who\u2019s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump\u2019s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if Trump were president and we\u2019re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of problems that have now been caused.\u201d\n\nThis has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he\u2019s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn\u2019t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.\n\n\u201cIt's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,\u201d said a senior administration official. \u201cSo that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba.\n\nHe\u2019ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning.\n\nBut the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn\u2019t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn\u2019t run her meetings this week by the White House either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a serious debate,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama\u2019s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. \u201cWe\u2019re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "label": "real"},

He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.\n\nThe actor said Donald Trump is,\n\n\u201con to something because secretly everybody\u2019s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That\u2019s the kiss-ass generation we\u2019re in right now. We\u2019re really in a p***y generation. Everybody\u2019s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.\u201d\n\nHe went on,\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, those things weren\u2019t called racist,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then when I did \u2018Gran Torino\u2019 even my associate said, \u2018This is a really good script, but it\u2019s politically incorrect.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Good. Let me read it tonight.\u2019 The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, \u2018We\u2019re starting this immediately.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump\u2019s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican\u2019s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind.\n\nThe icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference,\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody\u2014instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don\u2019t spend what you don\u2019t have. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we are in right now. That\u2019s why people are saying, \u2018Why should I work? I\u2019ll get something for nothing, maybe.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate.\n\nEastwood\u2019s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don\u2019t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash.\n\nIt is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood.", "label": "real"},

{"title": "WWII Veteran Pens Brutal Op-Ed Slamming Draft-Dodging Trump", "text": "7.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience \u2013 and sends a dire warning to the American people.\n\nThis man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:\n\n\u201cMy country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. \u201c\n\nAngell acknowledges Trump\u2019s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.\n\n\u201cI stick at a different moment\u2014the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, \u201cI always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.\u201d Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war\u2026I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at H\u00fcrtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded\u2026my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.\n\nFar too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict \u2013 or never learned them at all, as in Trump\u2019s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they\u2019ve served their purpose.\n\nTrump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle \u2013 negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, \u201cHow will I look?\u201d This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist\u2019s mirror for reassurance.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency:\n\nI will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President\u2014at last, a female leader of our own\u2014and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.\n\nHe saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House:\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama. A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news\u2014another police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning\u2019s difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this President\u2019s response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?\u201d\n\nWe absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect\u2019s six-year old son.\n\nAnd Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:\n\n\u201cStafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.\u201d\n\nOfficers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.\n\n18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.\n\nThat\u2019s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it\u2019s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.\n\nReports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.\n\nStafford\u2019s plea of \u201cself-defense\u201d is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy\u2019s grieving family.

{"title": "Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed \u201cWatered-Down\u201d AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Eagle Rising", "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,\u201cThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,\u201d was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "label": "real"},
{"title": "Trump\u2019s High-Energy War on American Politics", "text": "There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he\u2019s created. \u201cIs there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally?\u201d he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming \u201cTRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!\u201d That\u2019s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,\u201d a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn\u2019t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama\u2014\u201cWe call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?\u201d\u2014and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they\u2019re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.\n\nHis opponent does not. Clinton\u2019s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world\u2019s most famous and polarizing woman, but she\u2019s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.\n\nTonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven\u2019t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you\u2019re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game\u2014rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency\u2014and when 2016 is over, it\u2019s not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who\u2019s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d or \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The small venues are selected to target niche groups\u2014millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando\u2014and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very substantial, very specific,\u201d Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a \u201cHil Yes!\u201d pin to Clinton\u2019s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We\u2019re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\u201d\n\nClinton had better hope not. There\u2019s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can\u2019t match. It\u2019s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you\u2019re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It\u2019s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (\u201cIt\u2019s 100 degrees in here. And that\u2019s considered cool for an auditorium.\u201d) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell\u2014the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world\u2014then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump\u2019s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn\u2019t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton\u2019s campaign, like his accusations that it\u2019s \u201cpolicy-free,\u201d when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there\u2019s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches\u2014he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long\u2014with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\n\u201cBom. Bom. Bom. See ya!\u201d Trump smirked. \u201cSee ya! I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump\u2019s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he\u2019s shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I\u2019m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the \u201cbad, dishonest, very bad people\u201d in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word \u201csir\u201d to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as \u201ca big fat bubble,\u201d and predicted a collapse that would be \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: \u201cI didn\u2019t put him there! I\u2019m not paying him!\u201d He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself \u201cmore militaristic than anyone in this room,\u201d complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year\u2014actually the president\u2019s salary\u2014and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\n\u201cWhoever the hell brought this mic system\u2014don\u2019t pay the son of a bitch!\u201d he seethed. \u201cDon\u2019t pay em. Don\u2019t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn\u2019t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they\u2019ll pay, they don\u2019t care. So we\u2019re not going to pay. I guarantee, I\u2019m not paying for this mic.\u201d\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola\u2019s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: \u201cTyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and\u2026well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clich\u00e9s and Republican talking points about \u201cencrusted insiders\u201d and \u201cturning the page.\u201d He said the kind of things regular politicians say: \u201cThe history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.\u201d And: \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ll have a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd\u2014during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: \u201cWhat about white people?\u201d\u2014but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall\u2014but really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing \u201call the problems in the world,\u201d including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that \u201cpersonally, I think she\u2019s an unstable person,\u201d and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone \u201cright smack in the middle of the heart\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, OK?\u201d He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2014and then he had cozied up again: \u201cHe\u2019s been nice to me, and if he\u2019s nice to me, that\u2019s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that \u201cthe country is collapsing.\u201d\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We\u2019re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community\u2014which endured slavery and Jim Crow\u2014was \u201cin the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!\u201d Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline \u201cRestraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.\u201d Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton\u2019s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn\u2019t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn\u2019t make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasn\u2019t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it\u2019s that defiant you-can\u2019t-tell-me-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people\u2019s feelings, always watching our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, so it\u2019s cool to see him speak his mind,\u201d said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing\u2014he doesn\u2019t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn\u2019t stumble around like she did on the video\u2014Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: \u201cHe\u2019ll call a spade a spade, and if you don\u2019t like it you can shove it.\u201d Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. \u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we\u2019re offensive. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off\u2014at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn\u2019t want hate in their state: \u201cLazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!\u201d He explained to me that America was under siege, with \u201cthousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,\u201d and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition\u2014and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: \u201cWe want our state rights back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,\u201d says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don\u2019t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. \u201cTrump is saying what we\u2019re all thinking: \u2018Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don\u2019t end where your feelings begin!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as \u201cthe oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\u201d And he\u2019s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it\u2019s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll say it openly, and some people don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t really care: What do you have to lose?\u201d His long riffs about how he\u2019ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can\u2019t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don\u2019t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent\u2014the real rate is about one third of that\u2014he\u2019s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya\u2014and many I spoke to believe he\u2019s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. \u201cA lot of us who like him don\u2019t like the stuff he says about race,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cObviously, some do.\u201d\n\nThis really isn\u2019t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal\u2014a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams\u2014she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She\u2019s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn\u2019t been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton\u2019s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an \u201cInclusive Economy,\u201d to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters\u2014a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse\u2014about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton\u2019s concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a nice speech,\u201d Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. \u201cNot very exciting, but I believe she\u2019ll do what she says.\u201d\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: \u201cAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\u2019re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.\u201d Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. \u201cIn the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,\u201d Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children\u2019s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department\u2019s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she\u2019s known\u2014including the \u201cunbelievably good-looking\u201d actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that \u201cfamily values\u201d should mean that every family has value\u2014and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the \u201csub-minimum wage\u201d that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a \u201creally slow, vicious death\u201d to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn\u2019t feel bad if they\u2019re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton\u2019s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton\u2019s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn\u2019t even mention Trump\u2019s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down\u2019s Syndrome and lead a productive life. \u201cWhat Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,\u201d Kilsheimer said. \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she\u2019s got heart.\u201d\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton\u2019s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they\u2019re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren\u2019t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it\u2019s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump\u2019s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. \u201cMy daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We\u2019ve got plenty to lose,\u201d said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\u201d\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all Mexicans, and we\u2019re all bad,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they\u2019ll come out to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, I guess,\u201d said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. \u201cMy main worry is Trump\u2019s fingers on the nuclear code. But I\u2019d say she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they\u2019re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she\u2019s a typical lying politician, so they\u2019re voting for Trump\u2014and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they\u2019re staying home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s great on the issues, but it\u2019s hard to get people to focus on that.\u201d\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and recovery during Obama\u2019s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. \u201cWhen Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,\u201d said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. \u201cMan, Hillary should talk about that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn\u2019t focused on his policies, because they\u2019re so insubstantial and flexible, because he\u2019s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It\u2019s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump\u2019s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They\u2019ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump\u2019s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump\u2019s political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president\u2019s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can\u2019t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight\u2019s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won\u2019t be normal, but it won\u2019t be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though she\u2019s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo\u2014not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She\u2019s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn\u2019t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn\u2019t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they\u2019ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren\u2019t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they\u2019re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values\u2014showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren\u2019t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences\u2014that have constrained politicians in a good way. It\u2019s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they\u2019re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "label": "real"},

{"title": "Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at presidential debate", "text": "New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump.\n\nWhile she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University.\n\nThe lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.\n\nClinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health.\n\nTrump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, \"Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!\"\n\nJUST WATCHED They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH They can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23\n\nClinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks.\n\n\"I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,\" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. \"I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport.\"\n\nTo knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.\n\nClinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style.\n\nBut Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton.\n\nClinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: \"There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything.\"\n\n\"There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,\" Clinton said.\n\nA team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal \"debate camp,\" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday.\n\nClinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for \"Art of the Deal,\" the best-seller about Trump.\n\nExpectations game\n\nClinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event.\n\n\"For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,\" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August.\n\nWith her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.\n\nTrump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November.\n\nJUST WATCHED Debate expectations game is serious business Replay More Videos ...

But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,\" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.\n\nClinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen.

{"title": "Donald Trump, Germany\u2019s disfavored son \u2013 POLITICO", "text": "KALLSTADT, Germany \u2014 Few places in Germany are as representative of the country\u2019s heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather was born \u2014 and from which he was later deported.\n\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half\u2019s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig\u2019s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region.

But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic.

{"title": "BREAKING: Hollywood Legend Just Died Of Terrible Disease", "text": "Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken.\n\nShe was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.\n\nTMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr\u2019s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.\n\nCarr\u2019s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.\n\n\u201cI was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter completing \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business \u201cCharmian Carr Designs\u201d and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected \u2013 especially after being hired by Michael Jackson.\n\nCarr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.\n\nShe brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.\n\nI can\u2019t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!\n\nRIP CHARMIAN CARR.", "label": "real"},

{"title": "The Kim Kardashian sex-tape flag at Glastonbury was a particularly nasty attack", "text": "What do you give the woman who has everything? A short, sharp reminder that she can still be torn down at any moment. So it was at Glastonbury last weekend, when an audience member at Kanye West s set chose to wave an enormous flag printed with a still image from a sex tape showing Kardashian performing oral sex on her former partner Ray J. The tape was leaked in 2007 without Kardashian s consent.Kardashian, who is four months pregnant, was present, so she got to witness the moment the photo was displayed to her husband and a huge crowd of his fans. Printed on the flag were the words  Get Down, Girl, Get Head Get Down , a play on the lyrics from West s song Gold Digger. Luckily, a compassionate Twitter user immortalised the moment by posting a picture with a suitably disapproving caption:Jacob (@JacobWTurner01) Someone printed kim k giving ray j head on a flag and waved it about as Kanye performed at Glastonbury ahahahaha pic.twitter.com/QXrp1gedwLMany online were quick to share their glee, describing the flag as  the BEST Glastonbury flag ever ,  flag of the day ,  #BESTEVER ,  genius  and  hilarious . The Lad Bible declared that it  wins the internet . Just in case she hadn t noticed the flag itself during her husband s set, thoughtful users tweeted it into Kardashian s mentions to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home.The precise intent behind the stunt isn t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures.

(Presumably, this will prevent some early booing.) And the final change is a ban on Netflix films, which was announced last year but which will be implemented in 2018. The streaming company can still submit films to the festival, but no movie will be eligible in the main competition unless a studio commits to a French theatrical release.Among the buzziest movies that Cate Blanchett, jury president of the main competition, and her fellow jurors (including Kristen Stewart, Lea Seydoux and director Ava Duvernay) will be judging are BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee's drama about a black detective (played by John David Washington, son of Denzel) who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan and eventually heads up a local chapter.Everybody Knows, a Spanish-language thriller starring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, that opened the festival and brought out lots of celebrities, including Julianne Moore, Benicio Del Toro, Chloe Sevigny and director Martin Scorsese.And one of the true treats for cinephiles is the return of the French New Wave legend Jean-Luc Godard.

It also was the case on the CW s Dynasty, whose Season 1 key art featured Gillies, Kelley and Show.The dynamic on the show already changed with the introduction of Nicollette Sheridan as Alexis Carrington late in Season 1.The decision to make the stepmom Hispanic was an effort to bring the 1980s soap to the 21st century and better reflect the diversity of America today as well as add a race/class dimension to the family conflicts, though fan reaction to the character has been somewhat mixed.Asked about Cristal fate, Kelley, a Peruvian-born Australian actress, said,  Is it a coma? Is it death?   I actually don t know. But I know that I m not going to Atlanta in July, that I m staying [in LA] . I ve got my life back. ", "label": "real"},

Below, every skincare and beauty tip we re pocking (and purchasing) from the It-girl herself.1. Her skincare routine is a ritualWhen Olivia Wilde says your skincare routine needs to be more than just a routine and rather, a ritual   you nod and take note. Wilde shared,  My skincare routine is like a ritual   one that gives me as much emotional comfort as physical. She continues,  I was my face with [face wash] to keep acne at bay. Then I follow with face oil. I apply my face oil in a way that actually feels more like a face massage than anything else. 2. Skin care is a non-negotiable, no matter how pushed for time you may be.While easily pushed down (read: completely discarded) on the priority list when in a rush, Wilde preaches the importance of skin care   even if it means making switches that work for an on-the-go lifestyle.  Overall, my beauty approach is low key, but thoughtful,  Wilde says. She continues,  If I m leaving a workout, and am too lazy to shower, I used face wipes to clean my skin as I hop on the subway. They clean and moisturise, which is very helpful. 3 .Beauty isn t about striving for perfection, it s about having fun with it.Trying new", "label": "real"},

The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with  what appeared to be a bump  in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims!  It was strange to see because she s usually so perfectly svelte,  a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added,  Everyone is whispering that she s pregnant with her fourth child.  If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim   it s more than likely Scott! They ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,  the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017   but reportedly, that was not on Scott s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a  recent  trip to Mexico, the magazine claims!  They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,  the source said before adding,  Everyone is buzzing that she s carrying Scott s baby.  As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico", "label": "fake"},

Bitcoin is giving the power back to the people and it will probably end up destroying the New World Order. The anti-establishment Hollywood star says he believes that  Bitcoin is the road to freedom  and claims it will  free citizens from the economic shackles of the New World Order . Unlike regular currencies, cryptocurrencies are a decentralized currency meaning they work without the need of a central bank. The recent sharp rise in the value of Bitcoin has begun worrying major financial institutions who now see the digital currency as a major threat to their existence.Internet security guru John McAfee promised that if the value of Bitcoin doesn t reach $1 million dollars by the year 2020, then he will  eat his own dick on live TV. According to Keanu Reeves, the Bitcoin craze is set to spark a worldwide revolution that will see the end of tyranny by our New World Order overlords: For the first time in history, the people have a real chance at taking power back from the governments. When society chooses crypto over the fiat, the government, the central banking system, the economic slavery that they thrive on, all of that will be over. Governments borrow money from the banks to fund wars then tax the citizens to pay back the banks. We can finally end that cycle and give power back to the people,", "label": "fake"},

The campaign aims to raise $10 million for the film and features a YouTube video of Feldman issuing a warning about the dangers of child molestation in Hollywood. This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,  reads the description of  The Truth Campaign.   Ever since Corey announced he was working on a plan to come forward with more information, he has been arrested, had a near death event, and his band quit with no explanation other than saying they were afraid to continue. Both Lauer and Kelly pushed back against Feldman, asking him repeatedly why he was waiting to release the names. Feldman claims that he is afraid for both his physical and legal well-being. Someone tried to kill me the other day. I have been arrested. This is no joke. I am fearing for my life,  Feldman said to Kelly.  I had two trucks come speeding towards me on the highway at the same time. I was with six other people. I have many witnesses to this.

What took place in Manchester should never happen. What took place in Charlottesville should never happen. But they are all happening. And ALL of them are terrorist attacks. They strike fear in our ability to live our lives. They all make us question taking our children, our friends, our loved ones  to public events that are supposed to bring us joy  in fear of devastation. They are all attacks on our way of life and our way of love. As previously reported, at least 58 people were killed and 515 injured when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of country music festivalgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandala Bay Resort and Casino.

A kind and humble soul who opened up his life and home to the world. The aspiring DJ was Hefner s third wife. The couple wed in December 2012.According to reports Crystal will inherit nothing from her late husband s multi-million dollar fortune because of an ironclad prenuptial agreement and the fact that Hugh never added her to his will.Regardless Crystal continued to praise Hef saying she always felt how much he loved her. I felt how much he loved me. I loved him so much. I am so grateful. He gave me life. He gave me direction. He taught me kindness. I will feel eternally grateful to have been by his side, holding his hand, and telling him how much I love him,  Crystal told People. He changed my life, he saved my life. He made me feel loved every single day. He was a beacon to the world, a force unlike anything else. There never has and never will be another Hugh M. Hefner.

It claims TMG paid itself more than $28 million in contingency fees without a written agreement; failed to file or pay his taxes on time, resulting in more than $5.6 million in fees and penalties on his federal returns; and  loaning  nearly $10 million to third parties without Depp s authorization or proper documentation. In essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired,  read the complaint filed by attorneys at Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLC.

Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election,  we avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state. This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar   and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.What can we learn?Let s start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website   USALibertyPress.com   in February 2018:Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the  fake news  website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading on the claim itself. So let s do a quick search:All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false.

On Tuesday, McGowan also spoke about Weinstein and what she called the  complicity machine  that allowed his behavior to go unchecked for so long during interviews with Good Morning America and The View.

It d look amazing with leather leggings.Here s pencil skirt with nice clean lines.This tank worn with your most beaten-up jeans would be aces.A blouse that s ladylike without being prissy, which is nice.Velvet on shoes can be disastrous, but if the color is good enough, as it is here, they can really add a lot to an outfit.This blazer is just such a good green.I like the dressed-up feel of these Tretorns.The kind of tee that goes into high rotation as soon as it reaches your closet.Grey velvet jeans are nicely sophisticated.I adore this vest, and so wish I had the nerve to try and pull off a vest.Just a very simple top that could easily be dressed up or down.The choker collar here is really sexy.And why not a velour hoodie?", "label": "real"},

{"title": "Hiding Wrinkles: 8 Concealing Solutions", "text": "Minimize your wrinkles and fine lines with these eight tips:1. Plump Up With Moisturizer With age, skin becomes drier, making wrinkles stand out more. Bring that moisture back to fight the fine lines. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, which pulls in water and plumps the skin, says Joshua Zeichner, MD. He is director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.2. Use Retinoids Retinoids spur your skin to make more collagen, which combats wrinkles. You can buy products made with retinol over the counter, or get prescription-strength retinoids through your doctor. Both \"have been well-studied for wrinkles, and work,\" Zeichner says. Use them as directed, and be patient. Most products take anywhere from 6 weeks to 3 months to work. Wear sunscreen, too. Retinoids can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Wearing sunscreen every day can also help you prevent future wrinkles.3. Don't Overdo Anti-Aging Creams Take it easy. Try only one or two anti-aging products at a time. Using too many tends to irritate the skin, which can make signs of aging more visible. It's best to start with one product and add another product after a month or so. Look for ingredients like vitamin C or descriptions including \"peptide technology\" or \"growth factor technology.\"4. Makeup: Start With a Silicone Primer After you moisturize, smooth on a primer before you put on your foundation. \"Applying primer as a makeup base is the key to softening wrinkles,\" says Jaclyn Peresetsky, a makeup artist and co-owner of Skin Perfect Clinic in Ohio. Choose one with a silicone base, which fills in uneven skin texture and fine lines.", "label": "real"},

They thought it would be easier for her and her younger sister to break into the entertainment industry. They never expected that same industry would break their family apart.Joycelyn started college. The Savages saw changes in her behavior after she met Kelly. Out of concern, one day they picked her up from campus and did an \"intervention\".They asked her to stay away from Kelly but allowed her to go back to her dorm.

It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex-champ and self-proclaimed  male chauvinist pig  Bobby Riggs   fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop.The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life: the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken? How strenuously should the attitude of casual jokiness be maintained? No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives. The movie displays the same gracious good humour as its heroine.In 1973, King was enraged by the fact that female players on the grand slam circuit were paid a tiny fraction of what the men got, despite pulling in the same number of paying customers. She formed the breakaway Women s Tennis Association, and having duly punished King with excommunication from their club, the male tennis establishment was quietly scandalised to discover that, far from failing ignominiously, the women were finding support from the American public who rather liked them as rebels and pioneers. They got sponsorship and even some sympathetic press coverage.Then", "label": "real"},

USA TODAYJason George's character Dr. Ben Warren trades anesthesia for fire hoses in the 'Grey's Anatomy' spinoff 'Station 19.' (Photo: Mitch Haaseth/ABC)There's just not enough sizzle to Station 19.ABC's new Grey's Anatomy spinoff (Thursday, 9 ET/PT,   out of four), takes a look at a different slice of Grey's Seattle universe, following firefighters as they respond to emergencies   which sometimes take them to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital that's the setting of the long-running medical drama.Station, created by Stacy McKee and produced by Shonda Rhimes, marks ABC's attempt to create its own version of NBC's Chicago Fire franchise, with cast crossovers designed as ratings stunts. But that's a very low bar to aim for.The new drama's biggest connection to Grey's is Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George), who spent eight seasons as an anesthesiologist and surgical resident. Now, for some reason never explained in the Station premiere, Ben has cast off his medical career to become a probationary fireman. His choice makes no sense and is more distracting than anything else. The series would have been better off excising his character and leaving the Grey's connection to brief cameos by Chandra Wilson, who plays Ben's wife, chief of surgery Miranda Bailey, and Ellen Pompeo (as Meredith Grey) in Thursday's premiere.\"Grey's Anatomy\" star Ellen Pompeo appears in the \"Station 19\" premiere episode.

Though both she and her husband John were formally exonerated in 2008 thanks to developments in DNA technology, many still suspect that the former Miss West Virginia accidentally murdered her six-year-old child in a fit of rage over a bed-wetting accident then covered it up post haste. From the outside, Patsy was your pleasant and influential suburban mother of two, known for her beauty-pageant-winning daughter JonBen t and the lavish Christmas parties she threw every year. Still, several pieces of evidence suggest she may have had more to do with the crime than she let on.First, it's been speculated that while cleaning up yet another one of JonBen t's bed-wetting accidents, which are said to have occurred with some frequency, Ramsey flipped a switch and slammed the little girl's head against the side of a hard, blunt surface like a bathtub. Second, JonBen t was found with a rope around her neck, tightened by a homemade garrote determined to have been fashioned out of a paintbrush taken from Patsy s paint kit that lay nearby. Third, the most bizarre ransom note in the history of ransom notes: Patsy said she discovered a two-and-a-half page ransom note on one of the rungs down the spiral staircase that led to the basement where JonBen t s body was found. Written in strange verbiage that seemed lifted from classic crime films, the note demanded $118,000 be given to the \"foreign faction\" by 10 a.m. the next day, which was later figured out to be the same amount of John Ramsey s Christmas bonus from his company Access Graphics.

Sitting down for an interview on The Wendy Williams Show on Wednesday, April 4, Nixon recalled how she felt when the audience cheered toward the end of a screening in London. While applause is usually a good thing, the actress was disappointed that what sparked it was a scene where Mr. Big (Chris Noth) surprises Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) with a huge new closet. I was a little devastated by that,  Nixon confessed.  It seemed to me that the show was so much about female empowerment and about women making their own choices and women standing up for what they wanted and supporting themselves.

I knew Quinn wasn t dead, and it was kind of special and amazing and emotional to get an episode like [ Robin ] where I just got to see those flashback moments of Quinn to see how she s grown and changed in the last seven years,  Lowes tells Variety.  It was really rewarding in a sick way. Since Lowes actually was pregnant during production, the show shot episodes out of order with  Good People  going ahead of  Robin  so that she could  go off and have [her] baby.  Knowing the true fate of her character didn t make shooting the episode completely easy, though. I remember coming into the first day of the episode and talking to the director and saying,  How the hell am I going to do this?  It s my life, it s my baby s life, it s my wedding day. I m actually nine and a half months pregnant [in real life]. And she was amazing and such a leader,  Lowes says of Nzingha Stewart.  What was great about her is that she s a director that doesn t take a billion takes, so I knew I could really go balls to the wall and leave it all on the dance floor three to five times but not have to do it 30 times.

Playboy printed articles by Nobel laureates on the flip side of foldouts. Hugh Hefner hired the late Dick Gregory and other black comics to work the Playboy Clubs when nightclubs were largely segregated. He put long, crucial interviews with James Baldwin, Malcom X and Dr. Martin Luther King front and center in his magazine, when it had 7 million readers.

While coaching jumpers at Azusa Pacific University in California, Nieto attempted to demonstrate his signature move, but after his foot slipped on the track Nieto landed on his neck. He woke up the next morning in the hospital and was almost fully paralyzed; he could barely move his shoulders. Some doctors warned he would never be able to walk again.Further complicating the matter, Nieto did not have health insurance. But he was determined to eventually make a complete recovery. To aid his efforts, the track community came together and raised over $81,000 for his medical bills through crowdfunding via AthleteBiz -- the same organization that later set up Gabe Grunewald's crowdfund , which has already raised over $54,000.Soon after the incident, Nieto proposed to his girlfriend Shevon Stoddart with the promise that on their wedding day he would walk all the way down the aisle unassisted. (Stoddart is no slouch herself: she's a two-time Olympian in the 400m hurdles for Jamaica.)Yesterday, Nieto made good on his promise, and took his steps up to the altar, completing a huge milestone on his long road to recovery.\"People keep saying my recovery is really fast,\" Nieto said to the AP . \"I feel like it's not fast enough.

{"title": "Platelet Rich Plasma Vampire Facial Maine New Hampshire NH", "text": "Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)What is PRP?Our experienced plastic surgeon and skilled medical team offer the newest technology in using your own blood to stimulate rejuvenation. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) refers to specific components of your blood, the platelets and serum. Platelets are critical for healing processes and as such have been recognized for their ability to secrete growth factors and stimulators. PRP has been used for many years in the treatment of injuries to the musculoskeletal system; however, in more recent years, it has been incorporated into aesthetic practices as a tool to stimulate cell growth, including collagen deposition.Our practice offers the novel Selphyl PRP  System. This system provides the most advanced form of matrix PRP, providing over seven days of growth factor release.What can PRP do for me?PRP can potentially increase collagen production in the skin and subcutaneous tissues resulting in decreased wrinkles and increased facial volume. PRP can also be applied in conjunction with other treatments, such as fat grafting, to increase fat graft survival.How is PRP obtained; what is the process?PRP is obtained through a simple in-office blood draw. The amount of PRP needed depends on the surface area being treated. Typically only one vial of blood is needed; however, at times, two vials may be drawn at the same time. After the blood is drawn, it then undergoes a six-minute centrifugation. The PRP then remains at the top of the vial and can be extracted separately from the remaining blood volume.Do I need to do anything special for PRP treatment?For optimal PRP volume a patient should be well hydrated prior to the procedure. There are no dietary restrictions or precautions that otherwise need to be taken.What is a  vampire facial ?The  vampire facial  is a non-technical term popularized by social media to describe the process of micro-needling", "label": "real"},

Grissom starred with Feldman and the late Corey Haim in two films:  License to Drive  and  Dream a Little Dream. Feldman launched a campaign last month to finance a documentary that would expose the alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. He s seeking $10 million to fund the film, and pay for attorneys and security for his own protection. That is him,  Feldman said Thursday on  The Dr. Oz Show  as the host held up a photo of Grissom on his phone.  That s the guy. This guy, on his Myspace page and his Facebook page has pictures of me and Corey Haim,  Feldman said.  He still taunts it and flaunts it. The actor had mentioned the alleged assaulter in his 2013 memoir,  Coreyography,  but changed his name to  Ron Crimson  for legal purposes. The lawyers made me change the names,  Feldman added.  They gave me a list of three or four names. I picked the one that sounded closest to his name. Oz and Feldman then called the Los Angeles Police Department to report the allegations.Related Film Review: 'Corbin Nash' Corey Feldman Says He Was Stabbed, Police Investigating Incident It seems to me like they are going to take it seriously,  Feldman said.  They are going to do an interview with me when I get back to Los Angeles. However, they did give me the warning that based on the statute of limitations, they can only open an investigation, but they cannot promise that it will be prosecuted. The show later released a video saying its attorneys believe Grissom was imprisoned in 2003 for child molestation and is a  fugitive from justice  because he never registered as a sex offender.Last week", "label": "real"},

However, the prolific producer insists the latest extension of the popular franchise, Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, will instantly set itself apart from the many iterations that came before it.\"This is a show that has an agenda,\" Wolf told reporters Thursday at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. \"Your mind is going to receive information that I think will change a lot of people's attitudes.\"The eight-episode first installment of the anthology is described as a \"gripping, in-depth dramatization\" of the famed murder case that took America by storm in the early 1990s. When brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were tried on national TV for brutally killing their parents in Beverly Hills on Aug. 20, 1989, their story became a nationwide obsession. Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders dives into the players, the crime and the media circus, detailing the day-to-day battles of the trial and unveiling the shocking truth of what really went down behind the scenes.While Wolf had previously used the famed Menendez case as inspiration for self-contained episodes of Law & Order, Wolf admitted he was initially hesitant about whether there was enough material to make a \"compelling\" series. However, Law & Order vet Rene Balcer serves as showrunner and did extensive research that eased Wolf's mind.\"The research revealed things none of us knew, and that's one of the things that I think is most impactful about the eight hours,\" Wolf said.In addition to focusing on the molestation both boys alleged they suffered at the hands of their mother and father   one incident Balcer said occurred two weeks before the murders  ", "label": "real"},

{"title": "How Amber Rose Became an Unlikely Feminist Icon", "text": "The following January, in the middle of a Twitter spat between the two rappers, Kanye West ranted that Khalifa had \"let a stripper trap\" him, and even went so far as to say that \"You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me.... I own your child!!!!\" The obvious implication being that Amber Rose wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for Kanye, and if she wasn't famous, she never would've met Wiz Khalifa.Both are impossible to know, of course. Rose is, after all, an unforgettable-looking woman, one who had been making a name for herself as a video and print model before Kanye had even met her. (He went out of his way to get an introduction after her striking appearance in the \"What Them Girls Like\" video by Ludacris.) As it stands, it is true that real, paparazzi-level celebrity only arrived on Rose's doorstep when Kanye did, and then her relationship with Khalifa kept her in the spotlight as a trophy wife until their split in 2014. During this time, Rose tried her hand at everything from music and random reality TV guest spots, to a clothing line -- all with limited success.Rose appeared, for years, like a genetically-blessed celebrity girlfriend who had little to offer the world other than her stunning style and penchant for fueling gossip. So it's ironic that Rose seemingly only found her footing and her calling once she was single and after she'd been raked over the coals in public one too many times. Remarkably, in the last two years, Amber Rose hasn't just landed on her feet, she's strapped some spiky high-heeled boots on those suckers and trampled over every hater in her vicinity, in an astonishingly defiant manner.The shift started when she showed up to 2015's VMAs wearing a body suit", "label": "real"},

It first aired on December 20, 1965 and was the first of many shows created and packaged by Chuck Barris from the 1960s through the 1980s. ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it continued in syndication for another year (1973 1974) as The New Dating Game. The program was revived three additional times in syndication afterwards. The first revival premiered in 1978 and ran until 1980, the second ran from 1986 until 1989, and the last ran from 1996 until 1999 with a season of reruns following.Jim Lange hosted The Dating Game for its entire ABC network run and the 1973 and 1978 syndicated editions. The 1986 revival was hosted by Elaine Joyce for its first season and Jeff MacGregor for its remaining two seasons. When the show was revived with a different format in 1996, Brad Sherwood was named as its host. Chuck Woolery took over in 1997 after he left The Home and Family Show when the original format was reinstated and hosted for the last two seasons.Beginning in 1966, The Dating Game was often paired with The Newlywed Game. This was especially true when the two shows entered syndication; in fact, in 1996 the revivals of both The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game were sold as a package called \"The Dating-Newlywed Hour\".The program was originally broadcast in black-and-white, but when a prime-time version began in October 1966, both it and the daytime version were broadcast in color; the daytime version thus became the first ABC daytime series to be broadcast in color on a regular basis.Format [ edit ]Typically, a bachelorette would question three bachelors, who were hidden from her view; at", "label": "real"},

This will help avoid pigmentation on the face. Stick to a healthy diet of leafy greens packed full of antioxidants, fruit and veg.  However, the skin expert pointed out that in order to sport an utterly flawless skin like Meghan did on her wedding day,  several months of perfecting are involved .

Judging by Benedict Cumberbatch s hilarious brush with terror on Friday s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the answer is a grown adult wearing a cheap Iron Man costume.Notorious for scaring celebrity guests on her long-running talk series, DeGeneres set her sights on the Avengers: Infinity War star for her latest gag. You ve done just about everything. You have not done a horror film, right? Do you want to do a horror film?  she asks her guest. He responds:  Kind of. Well, as in, somebody was saying to me,  What haven t you done that you d like to do,  and I guess I d like to do a horror or a musical. Maybe both. Maybe a horrifying musical. It might be if I sing. Do you, in general, like to go to scary movies?  DeGeneres continues.  I scare very easy, and I have a rampant imagination  [but] you know it s like, okay, that s fake blood. Although I m still very susceptible. A member of DeGeneres  staff (clad in Iron Man gear) then jumps out from the table between the pair, scaring the hell out of Cumberbatch. Oh, f  off!  Cumberbatch screams.  You ve got to stop doing that. It s getting tired, but clearly not on me  I should know that happens on this show! The Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays.

He says it was a wild ride. I ve had shows cancelled before, and they don t get un-cancelled   that just doesn t happen,  says Ryan, 52.  To have that happen twice, [ Timeless ] does begin to feel like the show that doesn t die. Timeless  premiered on NBC in October 2016 and was axed after its freshman season with its audience hovering between 2 and 4 million viewers each week.Then, just three days later, NBC un-cancelled  Timeless  and ordered a second season.  We all know it s a competitive tough environment to get on the air and stay on the air,  says Ryan.  And the overall numbers were never big enough to make us feel safe. It was a little bit of shock when I first heard [it was un-cancelled]   like,  Is this really happening? Is it a prank?  What a mean prank this would be! Not only was it not a prank, it happened again, when during its second season, NBC axed  Timeless  again. There was no third season, but the network did order the two-hour series finale airing Thursday night   which Ryan says is designed for both fans and newcomers alike. We really did treat this like a two-hour event that you can enjoy whether you re a big fan of the show, a casual fan, or you ve never experienced it,  he says.

It didn t show a lot of the premise of the film, but what it did show was Winnie the Pooh in live action setting. While there were people the criticised how Pooh looked, the overall thoughts were positive. Having a film that has Pooh search out an older Christopher Robin seems like the exact film we need. Then came the release of a new trailer today, and I can say it hit every emotion it needed.Christopher Robin is a film that will show an older Christopher Robin, but showing a person who s forgotten about his past. Winnie the Pooh and friends seem to never forgetting about him, which makes the trailer seem so much more tragic. Anyone who watched cartoons or films of these characters can surely feel this. The film seems to follow a timeline that will allow Christopher Robin to help Pooh, but then make Pooh and friends help Christopher Robin. This is a great concept as it seems while Christopher Robin has forgotten about his furry friends, his friends never forgotten about him. It seems the only conclusion can be a sad one.Why should fans be excited for this film? Disney is bringing us to a place where we have been in other films, but it s different since we never saw this with Winnie the Pooh. A film that could be used as a comparison is the 1991 film, Hook, starring Robin Williams as Peter Pan. In Hook, Peter forgets about Neverland and the Lost Boys, but the longer he stayed there, the more he remembered. Christopher Robin will probably be more of a drama than Hook, as Hook was an action film.Overall, this is the perfect film for", "label": "real"},

So Rob Lowe and his sons join the legions of ghost hunters that populate cable with \"The Lowe Files,\" a goofy bit of Scooby-Doo-like hijinks for the A&E network.Opening to the strains of the song \"Don't Fear the Reaper,\" this rather odd series introduces Lowe -- who, no fool, promptly rattles off a list of his credits -- and his college-age kids John Owen and Matthew. Narrated earnestly by Lowe (who's also among the producers), the concept is for the trio to explore the paranormal and other \"unsolved mysteries\" together, beginning with an episode that features the Hardy Boys-esque title \"Haunted Boys' Reformatory.\"\"What makes us different from any other idiot who's taking cameras into haunted mansions and castles and whatever?\" John Owen asks, as they banter in the car.Well, for starters, dad is asked to pose for pictures when they stop for coffee and donuts, and the family has its own \"personal shaman,\" billed as a \"spiritual intermediary,\" who they bring with them to investigate the unruly spirits.\" allowfullscreen>The main problem with having actors participate in these sort of exercises is there's always a nagging sense that they're hamming it up, despite on-air disclaimers that stress the program is \"100% authentic\" and that \"Nothing has been staged for television.\" The elder Lowe also somehow manages to look dashing and handsome even seen through eerie night-vision photography while wearing a silly beanie.Read More", "label": "real"},

The groundwork for powerful men s use and abuse of women in the modern media age, scandals now exploding publicly each day, was laid by the Kennedys. They were expert in getting what, and whom, they wanted, in keeping it quiet, in doing damage control, and in silencing a mostly compliant media. Wondering how Harvey Weinstein got away with it for so long? Here s a primer. The Kennedys wrote that book.I ve been reading about the Kennedys my entire life. I learned to read, and started looking at the photos in Life magazine and reading the captions, when JFK was in the White House. The bad stuff didn t start coming out in volume until the 1970s. Howie Carr documents, scandal by scandal and year by year.You can watch as this once-most-powerful American family, the closest thing we ever had to royals, slowly loses its grip on its image - what we know and think about them. You read the truth now because they aren t feared as they once were. The Kennedys could not have risen to become icons in today s more wide-open media environment.Carr absolutely trashes them here. It s not a balanced portrait, but another way to regard it is we ve all been fed adoring and sanitized stories about them for most of our lives. This IS the balance.There was a lot to cover up. It s breathtaking to read how much they got away with. Patriarch Joe Kennedy was shrewd, nasty and powerful enough to keep family shenanigans quiet, but with his paralyzing stroke in 1961 they no longer had someone who really understood how to deal with, say, the Mob.When Jack and Bobby were gone and Teddy was the last male of that generation standing, it got worse, as he wrecked himself drinking and philandering.

The judge today ordered that same doctor do another forensic custody evaluation to update his first report from 2013. He will meet with Bryn and Jason, and then Bryn with Bethenny   separately but in person   and observe each of them with the child. While we bet Bethenny is annoyed by this legal hoop, it s certainly a fair way to assess Bryn s respective relationships with her mom and dad.

According to People, the Caputos officially separated in 2017 after 28 years of marriage, and after raising two now-grown children together. It was a shocking reveal for many of the show's fans, who thought the pair were unshakable, though their issues had certainly been covered in the past.\"After 28 years of marriage, we have decided to legally separate,\" their joint statement read, per People. \"We will always love each other and our two wonderful children. We are united in supporting each other and our family. Please respect our privacy during this time.

He is known for his performances in many films, in which he frequently portrays both the hopeless romantic or a sleazy, but oh-so-attractive jerk. Grant graduated from New College in Oxford where he studied English literature, and acted purely for pleasure. He never thought of having a career in the entertainment industry. However, Grant soon performed in a touring production of \"Twelfth Night,\" and started participating in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.Before becoming famous, Grant tried his hand at a variety of different jobs, such as writing book reviews, writing radio commercials, and tutoring. Eventually, Grant returned to acting, performing in many plays in England. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant was offered roles in smaller films, such as \"Bitter Moon\", directed by Roman Polanski, and intellectual films, such as \"The Remains of the Day\". His big breakout role that made him a huge star came in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" . It was the highest-grossing British film at the time, and Grant was awarded a Golden Globe. Grant went on to make films such as \"Mickey Blue Eyes\", \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Love Actually\", \"Notting Hill\" and many more. Critics often praise Grant's performances, however, he is sometimes considered to have no versatility in his career, and constantly turns to the same jokes. Hugh has been linked to a number of beautiful women during his life, most notably Liz Hurley. Grant and Hurley spent 13 years together before separating in 2000.

I know what you're thinking: What is \"Scooby Doo Papa\"?

Rather, it appears to be a brilliant idea on the part of some creative baristas. Its existence is possible due to the virtually endless customization you can employ when ordering your favorite Sbux drinks. \"In addition to the beverage options listed on our menu boards, there are more than 170,000 ways baristas can customize beverages at Starbucks, including selecting from a variety of milks, syrups, coffee/espresso options, and toppings,\" a Starbucks spokesperson tells Bustle. \"This high level of personalization allows our customers to tailor their drink to match their personal taste preferences.\" The Dragon Frappuccino seems to have been born from this \"anything goes\" philosophy, and people are loving it.The Unicorn Frappuccino originally came with a stipulation on its availability: You could get it from April 19 through April 23, or as long as supplies lasted. Indeed, it ended up being so popular (because, I mean, look at it) that the \"as long as supplies last\" part proved to be a key factor. Some locations did in fact run out of the ingredients before the April 23 deadline. So someone, somewhere got inventive and came up with what we now call the Dragon Frapp. As one Instagram user put it when attempting to order the Unicorn Frappuccino, \"They were out of the ingredients and offered me something not only cooler and better tasting, but", "label": "real"},

I am just quite an insular person, I guess,\" she said.\"I just  I decided in my mid-20s that I didn't feel comfortable sharing personal details like I had in the previous few years. And I just have run with that ever since. For all intents and purposes, she's still continuing to run that way now, though we do know a little bit more than before.

{"title": "How 'Aquaman' Saved The DC Films Universe And Redeemed 'Batman V Superman'", "text": "Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $483m worldwide, including $72.7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over/under $80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40% on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60% on day four after a then-record $84m Fri-Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa/Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it s on course to be their biggest domestic and global grosser of 2018.It is standard practice after any DC Films movie to examine what its success (or relative failure) means for the brand as a whole. It may be too early to explore the long-term impact, but at a glance, DC Films is now in a position where not every film has to justify the entire IP or the overall fate of the studio. Warner Bros. had a pretty damn good 2018, offering a slew of mid-priced domestic winners (A Star Is Born, Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean s 8) and big-budget tentpoles that did okay in North America and broke big overseas (Ready Player One, The Meg, Rampage) and thus finally declaring that they won t be entirely defined by DC Films and the J.K. Rowling brand.One thing the relative commercial and critical success of Aquaman means is that the series won t necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie. Maybe Shazam will be another goofy treat, and since it s from New Line as well as Warner Bros., I m presuming it s budgeted closer to The Fellowship of the Ring than The Hobbit:", "label": "real"},
