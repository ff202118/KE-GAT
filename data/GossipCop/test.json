Angelina knew Jared was a sore spot with Brad, so anytime she wanted to push his buttons she d bring up Jared and talked about how much she loved working with him and how talented he is,  the insider continued.  She even sent him a script behind Brad s back a couple of years ago.  Whoa! That definitely doesn t sound good.Another insider previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad really wouldn t be  shocked  if his estranged wife was dating Jared as he s always known about her  crush.  Brad and Angelina split in September 2016 when she filed for divorce and it was only recently that rumors of a relationship between her and Jared started up. Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in September,  an insider told Star in the magazine s Feb. 27 issue.  The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.  If they are together now it seems like Brad may have been right about Angie s  crush !HollywoodLifers, do you think that Angelina always had a crush on Jared? Give us all your thoughts below!",

It was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn t getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,  the source said to People.  She was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn t possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom. The insider continued,  All she wanted was for him to be happy and healthy. It was a difficult choice but the right one. On Wednesday, Ben Affleck checked into rehab for the third time after his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, staged an intervention, according to multiple reports.TMZ was first to report that the star checked into a treatment facility after Garner went to his Pacific Palisades home to sit down with him.

The first Netflix original series was House of Cards, an American political drama that just completed its fifth season. Since then, Netflix has produced dozens of Netflix original series and have even revived old shows whose networks could no longer afford to produce them. Because they have grown to be so respected over the past five years, many international networks allows Netflix to coproduce or exclusively broadcast their shows. In the past year, so many amazingly different Netflix shows have been released. There are crime shows, romantic comedies, reality shows, teenage dramas, documentaries, and so much more. Netflix streaming defined what it means to binge watch television. With complete control over what you watch on your laptop, actual televisions have become increasingly obsolete. Now, instead of needing to get the rights for a show, Netflix original series ensure that there is always something good and new to watch on Netflix. There seems to be a Netflix original series for everyone and every mood. Instead of sifting through the overwhelming selection of shows and their cryptic blurbs, take this short quiz and find out which Netflix series you should binge watch next!

Earlier reports were incorrect and not confirmed by his representatives,  Leto s reps said in a statement. A person familiar with the situation told TheWrap that the confusion stemmed from Ratner s mention of being in talks with Leto at an event, but said that no official agreement was ever made.Also Read: Playboy Puts Brett Ratner's Hugh Hefner Biopic on Hold (Exclusive)The clarification comes after the Los Angeles Times released an expose on Ratner in which six women accused him of sexual harassment and assault. As TheWrap first reported, Playboy has put all projects between their production banner, Alta Loma Entertainment, and Ratner s Ratpac-Dune Entertainment on hold in the wake of the report. Ratner had been attached to direct the film, and Hefner was attached as executive producer prior to his death on Sept. 27.Actresses Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn are among those who accused Ratner, with Henstridge saying he  forced her to perform oral sex,  while Munn says Ratner masturbated in front of her in his trailer when she went to deliver a meal. Years later, Munn said she ran into Ratner at a CAA party, where he boasted of ejaculating onto magazine covers featuring her image. Ratner, through his attorney Martin Singer, disputed the accounts.",

Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.

Do not disturb!~* ).If this Monday night setup sounds familiar (hi, everyone born in the  90s), I have some great news: Kristin Cavallari has a spinoff reality show called Very Cavallari and it. is. AMAZING. And by that, I mean: It s terrible, but I can t look away.It s been eight years since The Hills went off the air. Kristin Cavallari is now 31 and married to former pro football player Jay Cutler. They live with their three kids (Camden, Jaxon and Saylor) in a mansion in Nashville. In the first Very Cavallari episode, which is available in its entirety on YouTube, we learn that Kristen and Jay don t want their kids to be on TV against their will. Instead, the show focuses on Kristin trying to jumpstart her jewellery/home goods store Uncommon James, interspersed with some weirdly mean  banter  between her and the always-bored looking Jay.If it sounds extremely mediocre, that s because it is. The storylines are slow moving, the characters are largely one-dimensional and by the end of episode 1, everyone has looked directly into the camera at least once. And yet, I am glued to my screen for each hour-long episode and I think it s because I m so damn nostalgic for The Hills.Herewith, all the ways Kristin Cavallari s new show which airs Sundays on E! is scratching my itch for Lauren Conrad and co.The gang s all hereThe ladies of Nashville are relentlessly dramatic and the dudes are either total cheeseballs or totally mean.

He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.If that doesn t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.For the moment, it feels like we re not in Dublin.

During the TCA winter press tour in January, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said she was  cautiously optimistic  about an eighth season, pending a meeting with Kitsis and Horowitz, but that was not to be. When we first heard Adam and Eddy s pitch for Once Upon a Time, we knew it was something incredibly special,  Dungey said in a statement today.  For seven years, they have captivated us with their creativity and passion while reimagining some of our most beloved Disney fairytales, creating an undeniable global hit. Saying goodbye will be bittersweet, but Once Upon a Time  will forever be part of the ABC legacy and we can t wait for fans to join us in this epic final chapter. Once Upon a Time was a breakout hit when it premiered in fall 2011, starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle and Jared Gilmore, and featuring classic Disney fairytale characters.

    "text": "A swollen face, a bright red nose, and eyes to match are all telltale signs of a good cry.  These effects can last for as little as a few minutes or stretch on for a few hours,  says Marina Peredo, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York City, with a private practice in Smithtown, New York. But there are a few things you can do to expedite the process.If You Have 10 MinutesRun your fingers under icy-cold water (or rest them on top of a few ice cubes), then, starting at the inner corners of your eyes, press down on the skin until you reach the outer corners of your eyes. Repeat several times to help drain the fluid that has accumulated underneath your eyes. If you can, follow up with an eye serum formulated with yeast extracts (try Origins No Puffery; $26, origins.com) to flatten the area further. To combat redness in the whites, use over-the-counter drops.  One to two drops per eye is sufficient and should wash away the redness upon contact,  says dermatologist Debra Jaliman, the author of Skin Rules ($14, amazon.com). (Try Clear Eyes Cooling Comfort Redness Relief; $5, drugstore.com.) Finally, cover up your red nose, plus any other areas that have become flushed, with a yellow-tinted concealer (like Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer Kit; $35, 1.macys.com).  Yellow undertones help cancel out red ones,  says celebrity makeup artist Tina Turnbow. Avoid foundation or powder.  If your skin is irritated from all the nose-blowing, the extra makeup will look cakey,  she says. Instead, apply concealer only where needed and set with a face mist.

News broke in March that Capshaw and Drew   who have been with the Shondaland drama for 10 and nine seasons, respectively   would be departing at the conclusion of the current season.After a penultimate episode in which Drew's April Kepner came this close to death, the finale jumped forward a few weeks to reveal that she'd quit her job at Grey Sloan Memorial to \"do God's work.\" It brought the religious character's crisis-of-faith storyline to a close and was capped off when April and Matthew (Justin Bruening) tied the knot after Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo's (Camilla Luddington) destination wedding went off the rails. (Don't fret, Alex and Jo got married on a ferry, with Meredith   ordained online   performing the ceremony.)As for Capshaw's Arizona, well, she got her happily ever after as well. Following her decision to move from Seattle to New York so her daughter, Sofia, could be in the same city with her other mother, Callie (former series regular Sara Ramirez). What's more, Arizona revealed that Callie was now single as well as the former married couple seemed poised to start anew.Creator Shonda Rhimes acknowledged the duo Thursday after the finale.I will never stop being grateful for the chance to work with @sarahdrew and @JessicaCapshaw. In April and Arizona, they created powerful unforgettable characters. #GreysAnatomy #TGIT  ",

Olympios played both a villain and a heroine, a tightrope walk that defied reality TV conventions. While the self-described manager of a  multimillion-dollar company  was at times rude and over-assertive, she was also self-aware and funny, with natural charisma and a talent for transparency. Olympios  sex-positive approach to camera-ready courtship may have earned her a number of nemeses, but it also gave rise to a growing fan base (#TeamCorn). While Corinne and Nick ultimately were not a love match, Olympios  fan-favorite status all but guaranteed her a second chance on the spinoff show Bachelor in Paradise. And that s when this reality-TV success story took a dark turn.It takes a major scandal to break out of the bubble that is Bachelor Nation and into the mainstream conversation. This summer, niche Bachelor blogs and tabloid empires alike found themselves breathlessly reporting one of the biggest scandals in the franchise s 15-year history. The media frenzy began when word leaked that Bachelor in Paradise had shut down just days into its summer shoot. Paradise, a show on which ex-Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants drink and date until Chris Harrison tells them to stop, has always been wilder than its relatively buttoned-up sister shows. But according to those first reports, a sexual interaction on set had crossed the line, forcing ABC to send home the cast and crew pending further investigation.The dalliance in question was between Olympios and DeMario Jackson, another  villain  character from the latest Bachelorette season.

As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.According to Woman s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called  source  tells the magazine,  George loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal. The outlet s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been  advising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.  The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt  is very grateful  for Amal because  he s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.

Read on for more...Kate Middleton did NOT give birth to a baby girlYeah, you read that right; some people out there have convinced themselves that the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Princess Charlotte via a surrogate mother.Why? Well, for no real reason other than the fact that she looked so good when she appeared outside the Lindo Wing of London's St Mary's Hospital with Princess Charlotte on 2nd May 2015.One conspiracy theorist, who was quoted in a Russian newspaper, said:  It was a surrogate mother who gave birth but not her. Kate must have been wearing a fake belly showing to the people that she was pregnant. Another added to the Komsomolskaya Pravda:  She did not give birth, I am sure. There is no special maternal look in her eyes - this natural thing is not visible. This theory is, quite obviously, nonsense; the Duchess of Cambridge was just lucky enough to have a team of stylists on hand after Princess Charlotte s arrival   hence the amazing hair, makeup, and coordinating mother-and-baby ensemble.And the thing about the eyes? Utterly bizarre; all you need to do is look at Kate to see just how much she loves her little girl.Beyonce is actually Solange's mumApparently Beyonc  wasn t actually born in 1981; yup, someone who claims to work for the Department of Health in Texas supposedly unearthed her birth certificate and claims it has her birth date as 1974.Gabrielle Union, who was born in 1972, also famously said that she",

A fake article has been circulating around that uses a video to validate it. The video is allegedly of Jay-Z preaching about Satan during his New Orleans concert in November. The video is actually from 2013. There is not a bit of truth to the video, so don t share it.Was That Fake?Did an Iranian woman undergo fifty plastic surgeries to look like her idol, Angelina Jolie, but instead end up looking like a zombie? The internet is buzzing with reports that Sahar Tabar went under the knife to look like Jolie. She s \"Instagram famous\" and posts tons of photos and videos. But did she have 50 surgeries? In some of her photos, she looks a bit more normal than in others, which leads some people to claim she is using makeup, prosthetics, and Adobe Photoshop to alter her appearance. Snopes found a post from another one of Tabar s accounts where she said she has had some surgeries, but not fifty. She also hinted that she uses Photoshop, makeup and other tricks.Was That Fake?Will a beautiful, tiny Swiss village that appears to be straight out of a Christmas card pay you to move there? Yes and no. The Alpine hamlet of Albinen voted to offer $70,000 for a family of four to come live there. The small town is desperate for new residents, because only 248 people live there. The municipality will shell out $25,000 for each adult and $10,000 for each child. There is a catch -- to qualify, you have to be younger than 45, a citizen or permanent resident of Switzerland and you have to buy or build a house that costs",

So, it's time to set the record straight: Are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton engaged? It's far from the first time such reports have circulated, and when the couple has shut down gossip in the past, they've made clear they're in no rush to tie the knot.\"Everything's crazy right now so no, absolutely not,\" Stefani said in June 2016 during 94.7 Fresh FM's The Tommy Show last summer when asked if she was engaged. \"Can you imagine the amount of gossipy, weird stories people make up? To me, it makes me laugh every day. I actually do Google my name just so I can see the next one that's gonna happen, because it's gotten so out of control.\" And, though that was awhile ago, there's been no comment to the contrary from the couple in regards to engagement and marriage.Both Shelton and Stefani have been married before, Shelton to his high school sweetheart, Kaynette Gern, from 2003 to 2006, and then to fellow country star Miranda Lambert from 2011 to 2015, and Stefani to Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale from 2002 to 2016. In fact, falling out of love is what helped them fall into it. Shelton went through his second divorce around the same time as Stefani. By that point, they'd become friends from their time on The Voice, and they started leaning on each other for support as they recovered from heartbreak.Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty ImagesEventually, that blossomed into a romance of their own.

    "text": "It s here, and it was the worth the wait. The Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer debuted last night, featuring powerful images of epic battles, teachers and students, and a mother and her son. Here are five highlights that have us talking.1.  Raw, untamed power Snoke s opening narration, heard while we get our first glimpses of Kylo Ren and the First Order, is positively chilling. With just a few words, we get a sense of backstory and what s at stake right now.2. Luke and Rey.Star Wars: The Force Awakens ended with Rey reaching out to Luke, his first lightsaber   and his father s lightsaber   in hand. Now we see some of what happens next: Luke s shock, Rey training with her Jedi weapon, and an awesome display of power. Which leads to number 3 3.  Raw strength Drawing a thematic parallel to Snoke s opening narration, Luke says,  I ve seen this raw strength only once before. It didn t scare me enough then. It does now.  What his wariness   reinforced with tragic scenes of a past horror   means for Rey, we ll find out.4. Kylo Ren and Leia.We watch Kylo Ren in his TIE silencer speed through battle, closing in on his target   a Resistance cruiser, seemingly with his mother onboard.  Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.  He hesitates. We re on the edge of our seats.5. An outreached hand.Who expected this? A moment that harkens back to both Rey reaching out to Luke and Kylo Ren s offer to train Rey in The Force Awakens, it leaves us with a lot of questions. And will make the wait for December 15 feel even longer.There are tons of other great moments in the trailer, too: Poe s fiery speech, Finn versus Phasma, and of course, Chewie and the porg.

Rory (Alexis Bledel), Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), and series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino are all up for major Emmys this year   and all from completely different projects.

Both nominations, unsurprisingly, were for her role as Ofglen in Hulu's adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale. Meanwhile, Milo Ventimiglia was recognized for his work on This Is Us, NBC's smash hit and beloved tearjerker du jour. It's also the second year in a row that he's received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the show.The Emmys will take place on Monday, September 17, so fans have plenty of time to get a Gilmore Girls-themed Emmys party together.

These were serious violations,  City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.  It was essential to hold the defendant accountable for committing them. We have building and safety rules for a reason, and no one is above the law. At the sentencing hearing, we ll make our case for strong and appropriate sanctions. Hadid is the father of models Bella and Gigi Hadid.The Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/2rBq7DK ) says the roughly 30,000-square-foot (2,787-square-meter) mansion has entire areas including bedrooms, decks and an IMAX theater that weren t approved.City officials ordered work on the gigantic home stopped three years ago amid claims by neighbors below that the hillside above their homes had been destabilized.One of them, entertainment lawyer Joseph Horacek, labeled the unfinished structure the  Starship Enterprise. Some critics want most of the mansion to be torn down, but its fate is not yet certain.The 68-year-old Hadid, who did not appear in court Tuesday, will be sentenced next month.The prosecution wants the judge to impose numerous requirements, including hundreds of hours of community service, fines of $1,000 for each of the three charges, and a contribution of $250,000 to a community fund.Senior Assistant City Attorney Tina Hess also wants a bond to ensure that if the structure cannot be completed legally, the city will have funds to pay for its demolition.One of Hadid s",

Once the party headed to Florence, guests stayed at least a night at either the St. Regis or Four Seasons. Both offer rooms for about $885 a night. Multiply all that by roughly 200 guests and the hotel price tag could be more than half a million dollars.

With prices up to $190 a plate, that dinner alone comes in at nearly $4,100   probably much much less than the cost of the next day s rehearsal dinner, which included a performance by Lana Del Rey (Kanye is rumored to have paid her a pretty penny to sing Kardashian s favorite song,  Young and Beautiful ) and the subsequent guided tour of Versailles.Private TransportationIn order to get their guests from pre-wedding festivities in Paris to the main event in Florence, the Wests chartered two private jets.

Get EXCLUSIVE details.Jay-Z, 48, has been thinking about showcasing his talents in other things like acting, but after Beyonce, 36, had to stop an actress from hitting on her man at a previous event, she s not too keen on the idea!  Jay knows exactly where his money comes from and that is in music but as a entrepreneur he wants to dive into many other things in business and would love to even step more into acting,  a source close to the couple EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com.  But what ends up happening in acting is you have the chance of having a love interest and with Jay s wandering eye the one thing Beyonce doesn t want is to give him options. So if it was up to Bey, and she certainly tells him, she d rather have him stick to music because you can t hook up with a microphone.  Woah! It sounds like Bey definitely wants Jay all to herself. After being together for almost 15 years and sharing three children together, we don t blame her!Beyonce may be feeling cautious, but the two lovebirds have seemed to be enjoying their time together and recently took an early Valentine s Day trip to Miami, where they got cozy on a yacht. Bey and Jay have both been open about their marital troubles in the past and Jay even admitted to cheating on Bey during a rough time. After going through a rocky road, it s no surprise that Beyonce would be weary of any women having to get close to her hubby, but it s good to see the hip-hop royals still going strong as lovers and parents.Bey proved to be a devoted",

But after the latest Bachelor breakup to rock our worlds (Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell announced their decision to split just this week), we have one lingering question: Where do all the Bachelor rings go when the engagements are called off?Chris Harris has some of the particulars and a few ideas of his own, too. \"[The rings] go to heaven,\" he quipped to ET. \"I really don't know, because obviously Neil Lane gives these rings, but I think we own the rings at a certain point. Well, not me. I'd be cashing in my diamonds and living in Hawaii.\" The Bachelor host did offer up a few concrete details along with his jokes. \"The rings that are given back go back to [the production company] Next Entertainment or whoever,\" he said. \"There is probably a vault or bucket of just rings.\"While a source told ET couples are only required to return the rings if they break up within two years of the finale, Harrison did shut down the idea of couples recycling their rings in future relationships. \"Here's the thing, what do you do with those rings? You don't want one,\" he said. \"You can't give it to the [next] girl you love, because that's a tainted ring and it obviously didn't work out. That's bad juju. So I don't know what you do with those rings. Maybe we sell them back to Neil Lane.\"Former contestant Ashley Iaconetti has her own thoughts about what happens to those iconic engagement rings, which are estimated to cost between $50,000 and $100,000. \"[Production will] keep it, they return it to Neil Lane I have no idea,\" Iaconetti said. \"[Maybe]",

Keep reading for the most important facts about the situation, including quotes from Kelly's new interview.It's unclear whether or not Kelly and Michael actually like each other. In January 2015, Michael appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers and had nothing but wonderful things to say about Kelly. The clip may be unavailable, but the title that remains says it all. And yet, according to Entertainment Tonight, not everything is as fine on set as it seems. A source claims, \"Michael and Kelly have not been getting along recently . . . they got along great in the beginning, but not so much lately.\" This didn't exactly come out of nowhere. In case you're not aware, Michael has been a contributing correspondent on Good Morning America for roughly two years now. Even so, Kelly felt blindsided by the news. The New York Times spoke with a source close to Kelly, who says she \"was told of the move just minutes before the announcement, and felt blindsided.\" It all went down in one very dramatic meeting. The same New York Times source claims that, after Tuesday's show, Kelly \"was called to a meeting along with the show's longtime producer, Michael Gelman, and the WABC general manager,",

Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.And here's what Twitter had to say about it.Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all.

Blake [Shelton] is genuinely happy for all of Miranda [Lambert] s success,  an insider told HollywoodLife.com of how the 40-year-old  Came Here to Forget  singer feels about his 33-year-old ex-wife.  Blake is not surprised at all that Miranda wrote so many hit songs about her heartbreak because their marriage was full of passion, drinking and love. All the things that make for a great country song. Blake is relieved to have moved on from the most challenging time in his life, but he worries that Miranda has enough material to write several more albums about their time together,  the source continued.  Blake is hoping that Miranda finds new inspiration for her music and that she doesn t spend the rest of her life singing about him. Though Blake might be irritated by the idea that Miranda could be singing about him for years to come, he has definitely got too many good things going on in his life to be too concerned about it. The country music crooner has been happily involved with fellow Voice coach Gwen Stefani, 47, since the fall of 2015 and is only growing closer with her and her family by the day.In fact Gwen s little boys   Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3  idolize Blake so much that they recently drew temporary versions of the singer s tattoo on their own arms so they could be more like him!HollywoodLifers, what do you think about Miranda s songs about Blake?

(Actress Alyssa Milano, widely credited with jump-starting the hashtag, later said she was not aware of Burke s campaign until later.) That campaign is known as  Me Too,  and it encourages survivors to confirm a devastating, and largely unspoken, truth: That nearly every woman on Earth, and a significant minority of men, has been the victim of sexual assault and/or harassment in their lifetime.The campaign s effectiveness hinges on the sheer volume of posts where hundreds of thousands of people share their stories, from a simple  me too  to raw, vulnerable accounts of harassment and assault. As the accounts continue to emerge from everyday people and celebrities alike, we re going to compile some of the stories celebrities have shared over the past week or so that reach beyond the Weinstein allegations, in hopes that their sheer volume helps demonstrate the ubiquity of this problem.AdvertisementThe list is by no means comprehensive: We can t forget the women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of assault and harassment including Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Rosanna Arquette, Angie Everhart, Cara Delevingne, L a Seydoux, Louisette Geiss, Heather Graham, Ashley Judd, and many more the more than 60 women who have accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, the sexual assault and harassment charges leveled against Ain t It Cool News  Harry Knowles and former Birth.Movies.

She isn t even dating at the moment,  the insider reveals.  Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it s extremely low-key.

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim.Carey and Tanaka had split in April, but they're seemingly back together after recently being spotted on multiple dinner dates in Los Angeles. A photo even emerged of the two sharing an intimate kiss while cozying up in a booth. But the National Enquirer is now alleging that the singer is also seeing her ex-spouse. A supposed \"source\" tells the magazine, \"She can't seem to make up her mind which man she wants. She loves Nick, but she's got the hots for Bryan.\"The outlet's dubious insider goes on to purport that Cannon \"came to the rescue\" when Carey initially broke up with Tanaka, and she then \"hooked up with Nick partly to make Bryan jealous\". The seemingly phony source further claims that Tanaka is \"eating out of her hands again\", but \"when things got rocky with Bryan, Mariah runs to Nick\".But despite the magazine's attempt at complicating the singer's love life, a source close to Carey exclusively assures Gossip Cop she's simply \"not dating multiple people\". The tabloid's assertion that she's juggling both Cannon and Tanaka is entirely false. Unfortunately, publishing phony stories about Carey isn't exactly breaking new ground for the Enquirer.Gossip Cop previously debunked the magazine's fabricated tale about Carey and Tanaka having sex in a restaurant bathroom. We also shot down the tabloid's allegation that Carey used drugs and alcohol before her 2017 New Year's Eve show.

Rob s Instagram account was eventually suspended because of his posts, but then he continued his tirade on Twitter.In response, Chyna posted a now deleted Snapchat where she accused Rob of abusing her physically.As Gossip Cop reported, one of Chyna s other attorneys, Walter Mosley, made a statement on her behalf soon after Kardashian s tantrum cooled down.I represent Blac Chyna.

Most castmembers are making between $2,500 and $10,000 per week, roughly, for the 22-week-long (or so) season. Other answers referring to Jay Mohr and Will Ferrell are accurate.What s crazy though  Creator/Executive Producer Lorne Michaels has a net worth of $350 million for creating a sketch TV show, which showcases talent who write and perform sketch comedy (without Lorne), making about $60,000-$225,000/season to do so. SNL sucks now compared to its glory days (which, for me, were the late 90 s and early 2000 s), so I don t lose sleep over it.On another note, I miss the days where you could watch an episode of SNL without having to be beat over the head with political jokes. Heck, I miss the days where you could turn on any television channel without hearing about politics. And just like that, I have brought up politics in a non-political space. Damn!",

In fact, there were to be no guns at all.Instead, Angie would be embedded with U.S. Special Forces close to Kony s stronghold in northern Uganda and act as a honeytrap.

The family of the missing woman, a pair of FBI agents and a journalist are drawn into the ever-evolving mystery - sounds alright doesn't it? Well, it wasn't.

Scroll through below to see some actors we think would fit in nicely with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte.Sia Taylor Hill/Getty Images The Australian pop songstress already threw her hat in the ring on Twitter. If Sia was cast would Samantha suddenly have an obsession with face-covering masks and wigs? One thing is for sure: Her Sex and the City song would be better than Fergie s. Jane Krakowski Do we really need to sell you on this? Krakowski has basically played more outrageous versions of Samantha on 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

    "text": "There's nothing worse than spending tons of time meticulously curling your hair before an event, only to end up with frizzy curls, weird pieces sticking out, an embarrassingly outdated style, or worse...limp locks because your curls didn't even last half an hour. Luckily, we've compiled a list of curling iron errors to avoid so you can achieve gorgeous waves this summer.Mistake: Not Prepping Your HairIn order to get a good curl, you need to prep your hair first. \"It's like building a house,\" says celebrity hairstylist Patrick Melville. \"You have to create a good foundation for it to hold.\" To do this, first use a heat-protecting product (it's essential to prevent damage), then blow-dry your hair completely. This will close the cuticle and help hold your curls, as well as avoid heat damage from using the iron on damp hair. Melville also suggests using a styling glaze pre-ironing (he likes Hantz Professional Styling Glaze, $10 hantzprofessional.com) for control and texture. Also, if you know your hair has a really hard time holding a curl, go ahead and mist your hair with a little hairspray before you use the iron.Mistake: Curling Your Hair in the Wrong DirectionMake your desired part before you start curling, as this will help determine which way you curl the hair. For a more natural look, you'll want to curl your hair away from your face. This means winding the hair down and around the wand of the curling iron in a clockwise direction on the right side of your face and a counter-clockwise direction on the left side.This is the right way to curl your hair:Mistake: Twirling the Iron Instead of Your HairMost women clip their ends into the iron, then twist the iron in toward their head.

Included is an eyelash tint as well as a glycolic infused collagen eye treatment plus a full heated paraffin hand treatment followed by a light eye makeup application.

Welcome to the Cavs den. Yes, I m obviously predicting for the Cleveland Cavaliers to win the 2017 NBA Finals.

Although my shirt currently says  Defend The Land , that doesn t mean I don t think that Golden State is also an incredible team. So, lets talk all things FINALS.Before I get into individual reasons, here s why the Cavs will win the title in the short. Their resume, 3-point shooting, mentality, players in the paint, and the big three, LeBron James, 32, Kyrie Irving, 25, and Kevin Love, 28.Now, let s break this down. First of all, have we forgotten about LeBron James  insane performance in the 2016 finals, when he was the catalyst who brought the Cavs back from a 3-1 deficit? He went back to Cleveland and brought them their first championship in a half century! Damn, that gets me every time. And, I know what you re saying,  Well, that was last year.  Oh, I know. But, at 32-years-old, King James is playing the best basketball of his life. He s been averaging about 33.4 points, 9.0 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in the postseason. Not to mention, he s passed Michael Jordan, 54, on the postseason scoring list. Mic drop, no. 1!Kevin Love. Oh, do I love me some Love.

So what is Jessica Capshaw doing after Grey's Anatomy?While it doesn't appear that she has any projects on the horizon just yet   at least as far as her IMDB page will divulge   she's already joking with some of TV's biggest names about what her next role will be. Capshaw tweeted to Jane The Virgin creator Jennie Urman in March, praising her work on that show, and Urman responded asking if she could write something for Capshaw next. \"From camp BFF's to comedy wranglers on television,\" Capshaw replied. \"YES PLEASE!\"So, she's apparently open to new possibilities, and Capshaw's fans are eagerly awaiting whatever that next endeavor will be. \"I hope she finds something that makes her as happy and sunshine-y as [Grey's Anatomy] made her,\" Reddit user cattagatta wrote.Twitter is similarly buzzing with people calling for Arizona spinoffs and Capshaw leading roles.Capshaw hasn't really made a habit of juggling Grey's Anatomy with any other projects   she only has two other TV credits since joining the Grey's cast in 2009.

Following an unauthorized internet leak, the song was released on August 4, 2010, two weeks earlier than the intended release date. Swift was inspired to write \"Mine\" after reflecting on one of her unnamed crushes and explained that the song is about her tendency to run from love. The song contains elements of power pop and its lyrics speak of the ups and downs of a young love.Critical reception for \"Mine\" was mostly positive. Swift was praised for her ability to show a mature perspective on love, although some critics called the song \"formulaic\" for resonating her earlier works, notably \"Love Story\". The song was commercially successful; it became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada and Japan. The single was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to debut multiple tracks in the top five during a calendar year after Mariah Carey did so in 1995.The song's accompanying music video was directed by Roman White. The video chronicles the romantic relationship between Swift and her love interest played by British actor Toby Hemingway which ends with a marriage. The music video was met with great praise from contemporary critics who deemed it as \"rather sweet,\" and \"heartwarming.\" The song was performed live at numerous venues to promote Speak Now.

When serial killers are caught, after a long period of horrific, evil crimes, it s almost expected that their lives will be coming to an end. The usual sentence for multiple murders, especially ones committed by serial killers, is death. So that s why it s so remarkable to hear about serial killers who are currently still alive, most of whom are serving life sentences in prison. Very few serial killers who have been caught have been released from prison, but there are still some odd exceptions where the law and morality don t intersect.Who are these serial killers who are still among the living? How did they escape a death sentence while on trial? What were their crimes and who were their victims? Are these some of America's most famous serial killers? How did these serial killers murder their victims? This list answers these questions and more about some of the world s most notorious living serial killers.Many famous serial killers were murdered in jail. The male and female serial killers on this list either received life sentences or managed to avoid life in prison. These rare serial killers may have taken the lives of at least three people, some with victim numbers over 50, yet are still alive.",

I told you guys I was getting a weird feeling about JustJen. And look, I was right. Justin and Jennifer are over.Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage   and seven years as a couple, the Associated Press reports. The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin  in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest. The decision comes just days after the actress s 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday. Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends.[From People]I mean  again, I ve been thinking for a while that they were barely even together at this point.

A feature film adaptation of the series called The Simpsons Movie, was released in 2007.Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists.

Singer Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \"Dancin' Homer\". Several guest stars have featured as recurring characters on the show, including Phil Hartman, Joe Mantegna and Kelsey Grammer. Hartman made the most appearances, guest starring 52 times.

Meghan's been told to eat lots of beans, nuts and seeds, as well as plenty of leafy greens, wholegrains and berries.

This is a process, and my body is constantly changing. So is yours. And when I learned how to accept that I will always be like this, I relaxed. Our bodies do not stand still for time.When you understand yourself and connect to how you can become body smart, you realize pretty quickly that the perfect, the ideal is not the goal. Instead, the goal is feeling good in your body. That s what leads to confidence, to feeling and looking fit, and being pretty happy. Doesn t that sound great? I think so!In almost every interview she gives, Kate Hudson is asked the same questions: What do you eat? How do you stay so fit? What workout do you do? What s your secret? Well, the secret is that the sound bites the media loves so much don t tell the story, and the steps you need to take to have a healthy, vibrant and happy life can t be captured in a short interview. The key to living well, and healthy, is to plug into what your body needs, understanding that one size does not fit all, all the time, and being truly honest with yourself about your goals and desires.Like everyone else, Kate is constantly on the move, with a life full of work, family, responsibilities and relationships. In Pretty Happy, Kate shows how she honors her relationship with herself through exercise, making the right choices about what she eats, and constantly going back to the drawing board and starting fresh, instead of holding herself to unrealistic standards of perfection and giving up when she falls short.",

Peele s biting, horror-fuelled satire on race and richness would have made a fine episode of Rod Serling s classic anthology series, as Serling delighted in using pulpy scenarios to brutally satirise the whirling cultural maelstrom of early 1960s society.The question is whether The Twilight Zone can ever return to the intellectual heights that the original series reached over five seasons and a staggering 156 episodes between 1959 and 1964. A previous 1980s revival floundered despite featuring work from celebrated writers such as George RR Martin and Harlan Ellison, and perhaps because it lacked Serling s knack for balancing shock tactics with a strident morality and subtle liberal message.Jordan Peele on making a hit comedy-horror movie out of America s racial tensions Read moreEven with the presence of American Werewolf in London s John Landis in the director s chair and Steven Spielberg as a hands-on producer, the 1983 big screen reworking also failed to pass muster, and is now little-remembered.

The Royals also starred William Moseley as Prince Liam, Alexandra Park as Princess Eleanor, Max as Prince King Robert, Tom Austen as Jasper and Jake Maskall as Cyrus.The Royals  fourth (and final) season ended with Robert marrying Willow, Eleanor and Jasper getting pre-engaged, Liam and Kathryn discussing the future of (gasp!) their baby, and Cyrus at last reuniting with Violet.

Crews was referencing a tweet he posted in mid-November in which he shared a screenshot of an alleged email from RadarOnline asking him to comment on a story about him hiring two prostitutes while he was in Monte-Carlo, Monaco in 2015. Crews believes the story was a threat to silence him after he spoke on  Good Morning America  about his sexual assault experience involving his former WME manager, Adam Venit.

I had no idea it would get the response that it did; I was thrilled with that. But sadly, people still buy into it. They are consumers of this trash and they eat it up.

But for something that seems relatively fool-proof, there are actually a number of common mistakes made before, during, and after application. And really, who knew there were so many intricacies to a product that takes only seconds to use?But these mistakes are totally worth fixing because mascara is one of the holy makeup trinity (as I like to call it). As in, one of the three makeup game-changers. Brow pencils (or powders or gels, whatever you prefer) help frame the face. Lipstick (especially in a brighter hue) can help you look instantly polished. And mascara helps open your peepers, making you look more bright-eyed and awake.So if you've made any of these common mascara mistakes, don't fret! You're not alone. All of these blunders are pretty common, but super easy to fix. Your lashes will thank you for it. And in case you were wondering: Yes, it's basically impossible to apply mascara without having your mouth stupidly open.1.

Others -- mostly on the right -- viewed it as a vile, hate-filled address that was neither funny nor appropriate.Most journalists in the room -- and I was among them -- were largely quiet during Wolf's speech, particularly the second half when she got very personal about Sanders. (No, this does not mean journalists are humorless or can't laugh at themselves -- so save it.)I took a bunch of my notes on my phone during Wolf's speech. I thought I'd share them -- and expand on them -- here. These are in no order other than how they occurred to me. (You can watch the whole speech yourself here .)Wolf had zero interest in playing to the roomIntroducing the \"Daily Show\" comic, White House Correspondents' Association President Margaret Talev praised Wolf as someone who was very much not part of the world of Washington. That was seen as a good thing, given that the criticism of Washington and its denizens since the election of Trump is that they/we are deeply out of touch with normal Americans.

She did, of course: Cohen, as  reclusive Italian billionaire  Gio Monaldo, had Corinne pose in a hazmat suit in front of a greenscreen so that she could be Photoshopped into real charity work fighting Ebola, and then prodded her to invent a story about how she saved 6,000 innocents from being massacred in Sierra Leone. Olympios looked a little confused at points, but overall, fell for Cohen s ruses. When he asked her to assert that she was in Sierra Leone for a month, she dropped her  interviewee  voice to point out that  they  would know she was never really there. Cohen, as the expansive, ponytailed art director, waved this away, explaining it was his charity.Once she realized she d been duped, Olympios spoke with Vanity Fair about the encounter. She seemed fairly good-natured about the setup and in her line of work, any publicity works to her benefit. But reading between the lines, Who Is America? s devices appear more like entrapment than sportsmanlike hoodwinking. Olympios was separated from her manager and her phone, and when she tried to ask questions about what was happening to her, Cohen and his team repeatedly assured her that everything was  fine It s a big deal. You re going to be on the cover of this magazine. It s fine. She described being so nervous that she was shaking, and said the crew evaded her questions about her manager, pretending that he was on the phone elsewhere when they d actually sent him home.

Designer's ChallengeHGTVBefore DIY decorating was trendy, Designer's Challenge had traditionally minded designers compete against each other (very civilly, of course) to win big-budget projects.And yep, that's Chris Harrsion (the host of The Bachelor) in front of those floating circles.

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We're told it's \"not true.\"\"Grammys Ruined For Adele! Singer Stranded Without Her Team,\" blares a new RadarOnline headline. The accompanying article goes on to purport that the singer is \"freaking out\" because she's alone in Los Angeles while her crew is snowed in out east. A so-called \"source\" tells the site, \"Adele is panicked that her team will not make it out in time. Some key players were scheduled to fly west tomorrow but have just been cancelled by the airline.\"The outlet's dubious insider adds, \"With so many cancellations it looks like the show will have to go on without them.\" But despite many flights having been cancelled on Thursday morning, the worst of the storm has since passed, and many airlines have resumed service as of the afternoon. Additionally, it's expected that the airports will be fully operational again by Friday morning.Regardless, Gossip Cop checked in with a reliable source close to Adele, who exclusively assures us that the singer isn't concerned about the blizzard \"ruining\" the Grammys for her, and the claim otherwise is simply \"not true.\" This is simply a non-story.",

Michael Curry, the Chicago bishop who delivered the ceremony's sermon, electrified the service like few there had seen before.But, well, Prince Harry is still Prince Harry. And yes , we understand that our ginger-haired royal dreams have been, as of today, dashed but he still managed to steal our hearts today anyway (four times, to be precise).That quick lip bite:When Harry first caught a glimpse of his bride walking down the aisle, we could pretty much all feel his heart rate spike. As Meghan finally approached the altar to stand beside him, Harry looked visibly moved. \"You look amazing,\" he whispered to her before quickly biting his lower lip. Meghan smiled and replied, \"Thank you.\" Ah, true love.Admitting he could use a drink:Pinterest PHOTO: Jeff J MitchellFollowing the ceremony, the couple pulled away from the church in a gorgeous horse-drawn carriage. Meghan let out a simple \"Wow\" at her first site of the crowds. Harry, however, was little bit more cheeky: According to the Telegraph , who consulted with lip reader Tina Lannin, he said to his bride: \"I'm ready for a drink now.\" That seems more than reasonable.His reception toast:Pinterest PHOTO: WPA PoolDuring the couple's first reception, a luncheon event hosted by the Queen, Harry reportedly grabbed the mic for an impromptu toast. According to a guest who attended the event and spoke to People , Harry delighted guests by calling Meghan \"my wife\" for the very first time.

This Baywatch (** out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Thursday night) has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they re beating a dead seahorse.The comedy directed by Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) rests on the boulder shoulders of The Rock, who plays the old Hoff role of Baywatch honcho Mitch Buchannon. Instead of just giving out random suntan-lotion rubdowns and helping the occasional victim of a bad wave, these lifeguards are part-time superheroes who take on fiery boat accidents, jewelry-stealing grifters and rampant drug dealing along their beloved Emerald Bay.

When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom, just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,  Shelton told Geist.  It s a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time. Continuing, he added,  If Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought,  This is a rebound deal.

(Photo: PATRIK STOLLARZ, AFP/Getty Images)Only last summer, Duchess Kate of Cambridge was heard telling someone about having \"more babies\" and everyone thought she was just joking. She wasn't: That September, the palace confirmed she was expecting her third royal baby. Kate, 36, gave birth to a boy Monday, who came in at a healthy 8 pounds, 7 ounces.Here are some of the reasons why this matters:The succession: The new prince alters the line for the throne. He is now fifth behind sister Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, 2, brother Prince George of Cambridge, 4, father Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, 35, and grandfather Prince Charles, 68, the Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son.With George and Charlotte as their generation's \"heir and spare,\" the new baby becomes another spare but in a new era of recent changes in succession law that make royal birth order more important than gender.So the baby prince (royal fans began immediately speculating about names), will follow Charlotte not jump ahead of her.

After having a FaceTime chat with Carmella -- that, actually, buffered out for a minute, which leads to hilarity later down the line -- she decides to invite her over with the love of her life, Big Cass, and she offers for the two to stay with her and Miz. Carmella mentioned that she'd wanted to get out of Orlando and take a vacation to Los Angeles, since she hadn't been since her Laker Girl days. Maryse, of course, thinks this is as good of a time as any to have a sleepover, whether or not Carmella and Cass are ready for it. After special-ordering an eight foot by eight foot customized bed for Cass -- that, ultimately, doesn't fit in the house, so The Miz and Maryse put it under their pergola -- and ordering a taco truck (because Carmella loves tacos), the Mizanins are informed that, while they appreciate the offer, Cass and Carmella would rather spend time alone in their hotel room so they can make strange-looking children, or have fun trying.Naomi & Lana Fight It Out, Again, For the TitleAfter being told",

Plus, an unnamed source claims that the 54-year-old went to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon to get Botox, fillers, and some eye work.Stories surfaced last spring that Pitt felt the divorce has taken a toll on his looks, prompting his need for a little nip and tuck. But, could there be any truth to these rumors?Gossip Cop says absolutely not, and this is just a tabloid s attempt at end-of-the-year nonsense. Their  impeccable  Pitt source says that if he looks different, it s because he has stopped drinking and is focused on healthy living.An inside source recently told People that his divorce from Jolie was actually a good thing for the Fight Club star.

A dog bit her upper lip, and the doctor a little prematurely clipped the lower lip to the upper lip, which you can do. But basically it meant that she couldn t eat normal food. Dr. Dubrow said his was a female patient who d stabbed her own breast implants on the advice of a surgeon. This season on 'Botched,' I had a patient who had a really bad breast problem and didn t have enough money to have it fixed, so the plastic surgeon said,  Well if you go home and stab your implants and rupture them, the implant company will pay.'\"  So she went home on his advice and stabbed her breasts, and it turned into a giant disaster.  The doctors said they also had to treat a man who had most of his nose bitten off by a dog, while the most bizarre case of the series goes to the first ever woman to get her pubic hair transplanted onto her eyebrows. Outside of their show, the surgeons admitted they don t always agree to treat potential patients, and regularly turn people away if they re not good candidates. Many times. In fact, 30 percent of my patients who sat down yesterday,  Dr. Nassif said.  The reason why is because they want something unrealistic.

    "text": "This June will mark the 49th year since the Stonewall Riots, a watershed moment in the modern-day LGBTQ rights movement and creating the Pride Month we know today. Yet it wasn't until more than three decades afterwards that a United States president would declare June as a month of pride and commemoration for LGBTQ people in the country. And before we move forward with our celebration, it's important to understand how we got here.While the Stonewall Riots are mostly considered the pivotal moment in creating LGBTQ pride, major actions for visibility and equal rights were taking place beforehand in the 1950s and 1960s. Early demonstrations were done by the Mattachine Society, which focused on civil and political rights of gay men, and the Daughters of Bilitis, a lesbian rights group, with both carrying out Philadelphia's \"Annual Reminders\" which saw picketers reminding Americans that LGBTQ people did not receive basic civil rights. In response to the police raid at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn, now known as the Stonewall Riots, the queer community and its supporters decided they would meet in June in New York City to march and remember the incident. Originally called Christopher Street Liberation Day, the demonstration took place on June 28, 1970, with similar demonstrations spreading annually around the country and world. In 2000, President Bill Clinton declared June as \"Gay & Lesbian Pride Month\" and the month has gone unrecognized except for President Barack Obama later declaring the month as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month every year of his presidency.While the history is certainly a part of the celebration, here at Fuse we're using the next 30 days to look forward. We're celebrating Future LGBTQ History. Each day during the month of June, we'll spotlight the future of LGBTQ history by showcasing the world's most",

    "text": "High SPF sunscreens aren't all they're cracked up to be. ShutterstockIn theory, sunscreen with super-high SPF should give you the best protection against damaging UV radiation.But in practice, it doesn't really work that way.At best, high-SPF sunscreens give you only slightly better protection than a sunscreen with SPF 50, according to the annual sunscreen report just published by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). At worst, they could give you a false sense of security and make you spend more time in the sun   upping your risk for burns and skin cancer.Here's what you need to know about SPF to keep your skin the safest.High-SPF products don't give you a whole lot more protection.There are two kinds of UV radiation that hit your skin when you're in the sun: UVA and UVB. UVB is the kind responsible for sunburns, while UVA is the kind that reaches deeper into the skin and causes skin aging. Both of them increase your risk of skin cancer.SPF (short for \"sun protection factor\") is a measure of how well a sunscreen protects you from UVB. It seems like an SPF 100 sunscreen would give you double the protection of an SPF 50 sunscreen. But the truth is that higher-SPF products are only marginally better at shielding you from UVB, according to both the EWG and the Skin Cancer Foundation. SPF 30 blocks nearly 97% of UVB radiation, SPF 50 blocks about 98%, and SPF 100 blocks about 99%.SPF 30 is a solid choice. Chris Carlson/APIn 2011, the FDA even went as far as to call sunscreens with SPF values greater than 50 \"inherently misleading.\"Experts also worry that high SPF products might make people spend more time in the sun because they think they're getting extra protection.You should choose a sunscreen with an SPF between 15",

An  insider  recently told People magazine,  Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now. Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it  the biggest mistake in wedding history.  The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him.

Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d  area,  he tweeted.While most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it. Didn t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!  he added.Source: Justin Bieber TwitterHe also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison. You ain t cool unless you pee your pants,  Bieber wrote   quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.RELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Says the Weeknd s Music Is  Wack  Following Selena Gomez Romance RumorsBieber is apparently a big fan of 1990s comedies.

ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.Launch of the show will extend the presence of  GMA  to the network s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of  Today.  The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main  GMA  broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show.

Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled \"Spring Breaks: Part 1\", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in \"200 Cigarettes\", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in \"Gossip\" and \"Dr T and the Women\" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days",

But it s fair to say that Queen Elizabeth and the royal family s net worth is in the tens of billions   around $88 billion as of 2017, according to Forbes. Since the royal family s jobs aren t like the average person, how do they make all their money? The short answer: much of the royal family lives off trusts like the Crown Estate, which is owned by the reigning monarch and includes real estate properties like Buckingham Palace.Some of the royal family s wealth also comes from a portfolio of extravagant personal collections. The British monarchy owns billions of dollars in property alone, including Balmoral Castle, where the Queen spends every summer, The Savoy in London, a horse racetrack and an entire London street. The crown also owns one of the largest art collections in the world and the Crown Jewels collection, which is made up of more than 140 individual pieces and estimated to be worth at least $4 billion.Royal obsession, which neared fever pitch this spring as the world prepared for the arrival of Kate Middleton s third baby, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, and the marriage of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is thought to generate approximately  1.8 billion, or about $2.5 billion, for the U.K. economy every year.

Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million ( 18 million) and as much as $40 million ( 28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.Here's where all that money comes from.Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million ( 3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million ( 20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.Chris Jackson/GettySince age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government.

Jones said he was owed $30 million.Last week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was  cheated out of a lot of money  by the Jackson estate.During the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones  royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. Attorneys for Jones argued that those contracts entitled Jones to royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song. While the jury denied Quincy Jones $21 million   or more than two-thirds of what he demanded   from The Estate of Michael Jackson, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is wrong,  Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement.  This would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as  contract, montract,  and told the jurors he didn t  give a damn  about.

    "text": "Growing public interest in health and wellness is giving fitness careers a big boost. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth for fitness instructors through 2026 is expected to be faster than the average for all occupations. If you love health, fitness and teaching, a career or second job as a fitness instructor could be a great investment in your future.Education and CertificationMost employers hiring fitness instructors require a high school degree or equivalent. Some employers may expect, or favor those candidates with, an associate's or bachelor's degree in a health and fitness field, such as exercise science, kinesiology or physical education.In addition, certification as a fitness instructor is often expected, if not at the start of employment, soon thereafter. There are many organizations offering these certifications, but those from agencies accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies are the best known and respected in the field. Organizations such as the American Council on Exercise and the Athletics and Fitness Association of America are examples of these accredited programs.Certification involves studying for and passing an exam which will include a written portion; some may also include a practical exam. According to ACE, candidates typically require three to four months and 80 to 100 hours of study before taking the exam.Fitness instructors will also be required to obtain certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, and automated external defibrillators, or AED, through a certifying agency such as the Red Cross.Read more: 10 Free Workouts to Get You Fitter and Stronger",
