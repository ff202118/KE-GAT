Jamie McCarthy/Getty ImagesThe first Monday in May hosts the party of the year in the fashion world.Dubbed the Oscars of the East, the annual Met Gala was held on May 7, themed \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" to celebrate the Metropolitan Museum of Art's newest exhibition at the Costume Institute.With 180 pieces on display, featuring high-end, expensive designers from Versace and Valentino to Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, the exhibition focuses on the \"dialogue between fashion and the masterworks of religious art.\"Helmed by Vogue's Anna Wintour (and co-chaired this year by Rihanna, Donatella Versace, and Amal Clooney), the Met Gala is known for its best-dressed and worst-dressed celebrities, socialites, and businesspeople who walk the red carpet in their interpretation of the theme.Anyone who is anyone is there, at least according to Wintour's handpicked and closely scrutinized guest list.And this year's guests didn't disappoint, from Rihanna's pope-inspired ensemble dripping in diamonds to Blake Lively walking the red carpet in $2 million worth of jewelry.The cost to make an appearance during fashion's biggest night out is a steep one, and the cost to make the event happen is even bigger. For $30,000 a ticket, those who passed Wintour's approval can attend the $3.5 million event.And that's just the beginning of all the money that goes into   and comes out of   what Andr  Leon Talley refers to as \"the Super Bowl of fashion.\"Take an inside look at the money behind the Met Gala.",

She s done a commendable share of philanthropic work (although she doesn t advertise it) for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, among other causes. She s reached impressive new heights as a dramatic actress, with a performance in last year s Cake so heartbreaking that many believed it deserved Oscar recognition. And she wrote a powerful essay this summer, trying to redirect the endless tabloid attention on her to more important issues in the world.Nevertheless, when Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie were divorcing earlier this month, Aniston found herself swept back up into the magazine headline melee. Despite the suddenly aggressive tabloid and paparazzi attention since news of a celebrity breakup that has nothing to do with her, it seems as though Aniston has gone about her business as usual joining husband Justin Theroux in New York this week for the premiere of his latest film, The Girl on the Train. And while there, Theroux was tossed a question about the Brangelina breakup and Aniston s new involvement in the headlines. Rather than refuse to answer the question, as is certainly his red-carpet right, the Leftovers actor took the decidedly classy route in responding. As a child of divorce all I can say is that s terrible news for those children and that's all you can really say,  Theroux told the Business Insider, referring to Pitt and Jolie s six children.  It s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time, that's horrible. Theroux also commented on the fact that Aniston has been dragged back into Pitt-Jolie headlines of late, calling the new tabloid narratives  nonsense.

Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) instantly changes course and supports Jo, refusing to let her be alone in the same room when Paul and his new bride-to-be Jenny (guest star Bethany Joy Lenz, One Tree Hill) come calling with divorce papers.Jo, realizing that she does not want another woman to suffer the same experience at Paul's hands, does her best to warn Jenny. However, she seems to believe the Paul's spin that Jo is crazy, as he attempted to discredit his estranged wife by calling her a party girl and alcoholic.After Paul learns of Jo's efforts to get to Jenny, he confronts   and scares the crap   out of Jo, who realizes he now knows where to find her and how to reach her.

    "text": "It's time to say goodbye to a dear friend. We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message \"#ShavedButNotForgotten.\"You can watch the full video above!\"I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,\" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. \"Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.\"It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, \"It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.\"The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's \"I Will Remember You\" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.So long, King",

Which feels more like a trick than a treat.The Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals  Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline.But it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega   who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants   isn t involved either.This news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades   and as recently as yesterday!It s taken so long that Midler s enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015,  After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.  But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying,  I would love [to do a sequel].

They say that the  wild child  daughter of Michael Jackson has gone completely off the rails and that her family is concerned that she might be doing drugs to cope with the stress of her new modelling and acting career.But Gossip Cop has looked into the rumors that Paris is currently doing drugs now, and it looks like they are false. The family worries the stress of Paris s booming modeling and acting career has catapulted her into substance abuse,  one  source  said to the National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.The Enquirer also claims that The Jacksons are concerned about health of the matriarch and patriarch of the family, Katherine and Joe.  The Jackson parents, both in their 80s, are fading fast,  the source claims.Paris had a very difficult adolescence after her father died. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she revealed that she was sexually assaulted at age 14. She also admitted she had cut herself, attempted suicide  multiple times,  and had been using drugs as well. Tattoos now cover the scars and track marks from the drug abuse.But as for whether she is using drugs now, Gossip Cop interviewed her press rep who told them that the claims made by the National Enquirer were unfounded.Since her stint in rehab, Paris seems to be doing a lot better. She s currently signed to IMG models and has started acting as well, with a recent guest role on Fox s Star.???? A post shared by Paris-Michael K. Jackson (@parisjackson) on Aug 16, 2017 at 5:56am PDTThis isn t the first time that the National Enquirer has made up stories about Paris Jackson. They previously claimed that Paris was set to join Keeping Up",

    "text": "Chlo  Grace Moretz has flawless skin, but the 19-year-old actress says it hasn t always been that way. In an interview with Allure , Moretz says she had bad cystic acne when she was growing up. Now, she says her skin is acne-free thanks to Accutane and a healthy diet , but she points out that having skin problems  was a long, hard, emotional process. Moretz says she also works to keep her skin gorgeous thanks to an unorthodox facial cleansing method: She washes her face with olive oil .  I swear my skin is so much clearer because of it,  Moretz tells Allure .It sounds weird, but Moretz isn t the only one on the oil-cleansing bandwagon. Pinterest features several pins on olive oil face wash how-tos.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that people look for a cream or ointment that contains olive or jojoba oil to combat dry skin, but makes no mention of actually cleansing with it. But Gary Goldenberg , M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that there is something to washing your face with olive oil especially if you have dry skin or eczema.  Olive oil is known to have anti-inflammatory properties,  he says.  It's also a very good moisturizer.  Goldenberg says he has many patients who wash with either olive oil or other natural oils.Fans of oil cleansing and there are many say it works by dissolving the oils that are already on your face. Cynthia Bailey , M.D., a diplomat of the American Board of Dermatology and president and CEO of Advanced Skin Care and Dermatology Inc., tells SELF that this is correct. \"Oil will dissolve oily skin residue because like dissolves like,\" she explains. \"If you use moisturizers or makeup that are oil-based, the olive",

    "text": "Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.The world s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill. I don t do a lot of media. I don t want to be seen everywhere,  the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair.  Today, I m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don t stick my nose into everything publicly. Jenner s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show,  I Am Cait. Her newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner   who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner   to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a",

The plan is for Remini to develop a range of documentary content, beyond the subject of Scientology, for A&E, Lifetime, History and other in-house A+E platforms. I am so incredibly proud of this show and the movement that has started around it which continues to grow each and every day,  said Remini.  I m honored to have a home at A+E Networks and am grateful and humbled to have the opportunity to expand our relationship telling brave stories and bringing truth to light, no matter the obstacles. Scientology and the Aftermath  won the Emmy for informational series last year. The veteran actress  expose of the organization birthed by L. Ron Hubbard is one of a handful of docu-series successes (notably  60 Days In  and  Live P.D. ) that have generated renewed momentum for A&E, which had been struggling with double-digit viewership losses.A+E Originals was crafted by Paul Buccieri, president of A+E Networks Portfolio Group & A+E Studios, and a former unscripted producer. He s also serving as interim steward, with COO/CFO David Granville-Smith, of the entire A+E group as parent companies Hearst and Disney look for a CEO successor for Nancy Dubuc, who exited last month to become CEO of Vice.

    "text": "Eyebrows have many capabilities. For those like Cara Delevingne , they can make your career. For those like Kendall Jenner, they can cement your status as a serious model, because only those actually committed to the runway would bleach their brows and become full-on goth for at Marc Jacobs . And, well, as for both celebrities and, you know, normal people? Eyebrows of course also serve the central purpose of subtly and effectively keeping sweat and debris from falling into your eyes, thereby protecting your vision.But none of these capabilities, apparently, appeal to Antonio Banderas , who, at the moment, seems to be completely devoid of eyebrows. On Wednesday, the 57-year-old actor stepped out on a red carpet in Madrid without any visible hair on his head. (Okay, he still has his eyelashes, but that's an oversight we're quite thankful for.) According to E! , the look is ostensibly part of his getting into character for his starring role as Pablo Picasso in the upcoming National Geographic series Genius: Picasso . Take a closer look at the red carpet, though, and you may start to question this reasoning.Loading View on InstagramWhat's that Banderas is standing in front of? A larger-than-life photo of his face in his portrayal of Picasso, in which the artist has eyebrows . We haven't seen the series yet, so it's unclear whether the poster is simply a less jarring image of Banderas than that which will appear onscreen, or if the two looks simply show Picasso at different stages of his life, since Banderas had previously shared a photo of himself in the role with plenty of gray hair on his face. When he made a lower-key red-carpet appearance sans eyebrows back in December, it simply seemed likely he was still finishing up filming. That possibility",

Here s why she s  happier  with a more low-key celebration.Taylor Swift, 28, has thrown some pretty epic Fourth of July parties in years past, but she s forwent the epic celebration in 2017, and now again in 2018. This year, she instead spent her time off from touring to go to Turks and Caicos with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, 27. Taylor likes keeping things a little more low key nowadays because it works for her to have alone time and she is enjoying the time she needs and has with Joe,  a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.  It is very important for her for that to be private. The 10-time Grammy winner has been keeping her relationship under wraps. The pair have only been photographed out together a handful of times despite dating for well over a year. Taylor also rescinded from the spotlight in 2016, and has been living more privately ever since. Our insider adds that the  Delicate  hitmaker intends on keeping her life this way.  She is not interested in all the craziness from previous years. She has matured to this way of life and it fits and suits her so well,  our source explains.  She is happy and healthy and she ll definitely continue this moving forward. Taymerica might be a thing of the past, but fans were still delighted when paparazzi photos of their idol surfaced online on July 5.

Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year! Up until Thursday, it was understood that Gigi would be joining her sister and walking the show for the third year in a row. The abrupt announcement has many fans speculating as to why she will not be there. While some have cited other models having issues with Visa s, the majority feel that it might have something to do with a viral video of her that was posted to Snapchat a few months ago. In the video , Gigi is shown squinting her eyes while holding a Buddha, which was seen as extremely offensive. With the show taking place in Shanghai, commenters called for the model to drop out almost immediately after news broke that she was joining the 2017 model cast. Despite a written apology several months after the incident, it appears several fans were still held a grudge.After she announced on social media that she wouldn't be walking in Shanghai after all, one person replied to her post, stating:  It s what you deserved after that offensive video, and your white ass couldn t even publicly apologize.

    "text": "Let's face it. The franchise just hasn't been the same since fan favorite NeNe Leakes departed The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after Season 7. But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?The explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she's rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo's The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. \"I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I'm back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!\" she said.Fans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn't return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.In 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had \"been lifted off of [her] shoulders.\" That's no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn't",

He later said in an amended complaint to his 2013 lawsuit that MJJ Productions, the late musician s entertainment company, and MJJ Ventures were operations  specifically designed to locate, attract, lure and seduce child sexual abuse victims.

As demonstrated by the defendants, Neverland Valley Ranch, where some of the abuse is alleged to have occurred, was owned by Michael Jackson, not either of the corporate defendants,  Beckloff said.  Similarly, Michael Jackson in his individual capacity owned the apartments where other abuse is alleged to have occurred.

There is no dispute plaintiff brought this action well after his 26th birthday,  said Beckloff.

    "text": "By Laura Woods/GoBankingRatesOn Oct. 3, 1995, a jury acquitted Orenthal James \"O.J.\" Simpson of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The murders -- and resulting O.J. Simpson trial and verdict -- drastically changed many peoples' opinions of the former football sensation.More than two decades later, Simpson sits behind bars after being convicted for entirely different crimes. But that could change soon. On Thursday, Simpson will appear before a Nevada judge to make his case for parole. If parole is granted, \"The Juice\" could be on the loose as soon as Oct. 1.In anticipation of the hearing, let's take a look at O.J. Simpson's net worth, as well as revisit his infamous murder trial.Estimated net worth: $250,000His bank account was once flush, but O.J. Simpson now has little money left from his days has a high-earning football star. Celebrity Net Worth reports O.J. Simpson's net worth was $10.8 million when he and Nicole Brown Simpson divorced in 1992. That sum is equal to more than $19 million as of May 2017.The divorce settlement revealed Simpson was earning $55,000 per month in 1992   more than $97,000 in May 2017 dollars. Much of this was from car rental company Hertz, where he served as spokesperson for nearly 20 years. Simpson was earning $550,000 per year from the company at the time of his divorce, according to The Washington Post.From the archives: Former \"48 Hours\" reporter Harold Dow goes 1-on-1 with OJ SimpsonMoney has seemingly been tight for Simpson since the Nicole Brown murder trial. Despite being acquitted in the famous criminal case, he was found guilty in a subsequent civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families in February 1997.

In the days since we have heard from a few members of the franchise family, including Dave Bautista, Sean Gunn, and Michael Rooker - but two key names we didn't hear from were Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. Now the two actors have broken their silence and posted mostly vague responses to the news on their respective social media channels: It s been a challenging weekend I m not gonna lie. I m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will.   Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) July 22, 2018 Without mentioning James Gunn by name, Zoe Saldana took to her personal Twitter account this afternoon to post a message about everything that has been happening. It seems that she is not yet ready to release a full comment on the situation, and instead simply stated that she loves \"ALL members of [the] GOTG family.\" As for Chris Pratt's response to the James Gunn news, his message was even more cryptic. The actor, who saw his entire career change after being cast in Guardians of the Galaxy, chose a Bible verse as his means of communicating his thoughts - notably choosing a quotation from the Epistle of James in the New Testament:  Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. JAMES 1:19??????   chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) July 22, 2018 Dave Bautista also noted",

A big chunk of their net worth obviously comes from Fixer Upper, which reportedly earns them $30,000 an episode from homeowners seeking renovations, plus an undisclosed fee from HGTV. But the Gaines  have far more revenue sources adding to their net worth to boot.The Magnolia umbrella includes Magnolia Homes, the couple s renovation business; Magnolia Realty, a real estate agency selling homes throughout Texas in cities like Waco, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, Houston and San Antonio; Magnolia Silos, a boutique marketplace in Waco selling home decor and food truck-cuisine; the Magnolia Journal, a quarterly magazine that reportedly boasts 700,000 subscribers paying $20 a year; and last, but not least, the Magnolia House and soon-to-open Hillcrest Estate, luxury rental properties that fetch at least $600 a night.That s not to mention the Gaines  book deals, which were likely lucrative given their celebrity status.

The  Keeping Up With the Kardashians  star and the professional athlete has also enjoyed lunch and dinner dates together.A source told US Weekly last month that even though the two have not yet confirmed that they re dating, they already have been a couple since October.  They re legit. They re a full-on couple. Kendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They re good,  the source said.Jenner and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, also went on a double date with Griffin and Travis Scott on Oct. 15 at the Universal Studios  Halloween Horror Nights.

However, the tabloid s story has now been debunked as false and proven to be a product of fabrications made by unreliable sources.On Monday, Gossip Cop called out the magazine for publishing a baseless story in its latest issue. According to the fact-checking celebrity reporting site, the tabloid fabricated the story by citing an unknown source who is claiming that Pitt is planning to file court documents to subpoena a person named Anna Kowalski to prove the  Maleficent  actress  infidelity in court.Kowalski is the woman identified by another tabloid, named Star, who can corroborate Jolie s alleged affair with her dialect coach while she was filming her spy film  Salt  in 2009. Kowalski was allegedly a housekeeper at New York s Waldorf Astoria at the time and she allegedly witnessed the clandestine romance between the actress and the teacher. Brad couldn t believe it when he heard Anna s claims,  NW quoted its source as saying.  You can bet that he s going to have his lawyers use her anyway they can to get him equal custody of his kids.  The source s claim, however, contradicts The Blast s recent report that says the custody talks between the  Mr. & Mrs. Smith  co-stars have been amicable and going on  peacefully. Furthermore, it doesn t make sense for NW s source to claim that Pitt s camp is seeking to subpoena Kowalski because the person does not exist. A Waldorf Astoria spokesperson clarified to E!

Fans were stunned to hear the news that the pair had decided to end their nine-year marriage and couldn t help but wonder what caused the sad breakup.According to an April 3 report by Radar Online, there were many factors that led to the end of Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan s marriage. The first is likely the fact that Tatum wanted to have more children. The actor and his estranged wife are the parents of one daughter, Everly, but it seems that the Magic Mike star wanted a bigger family, which is something that Dewan didn t seem to be on board with. A past report by OK! Magazine claims that Jenna wanted to get back into acting and that caring for a newborn would derail those plans.The baby battle allegedly continued for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan when the actress got tired of being a housewife while her husband spent his time on movie sets. A source revealed that Tatum made more than enough money to support the family and that he wanted Dewan at home with little Everly so she would not be raised by nannies.The jealousy allegedly began to rise in Jenna Dewan as Channing Tatum hit new levels of success with movies like 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and their sequels. The pair met on the set of the film Step Up as equals in their careers, but Channing s celebrity surpassed Jenna s over the years. However, that wasn t all Jenna was reportedly jealous of.Channing Tatum has become a sex symbol in Hollywood, and women flock to him wherever he goes. The actor will often create a",

    "text": "Update (Dec. 14): Disney has announced that it will acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox assets, including the rights to X-Men, Avatar, FX Networks, and The Simpsons.Original story: Disney and 21st Century Fox are expected to close a deal this week giving Disney ownership over Fox s TV and film properties.This means Disney will own the rights to certain Marvel franchises, such as The X-Men, Deadpool and The Fantastic Four. The film rights to Marvel Comics characters have been divided for quite some time; Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man, for example, which meant that up until very recently, Marvel Studios couldn t use Spider-Man in its movies. It was only when a deal was struck between Disney and Sony Pictures in 2015 that the former company could license the character for its Marvel Cinematic Universe films. This upcoming acquisition is a little different.Unlike the Spider-Man situation, in which Sony still owns the rights to the character, Disney would fully own the rights to every Marvel superhero currently under Fox s banner. The company won t have to rely on licensing to feature Wolverine in an Avengers movie.For some actors and directors, the move to create a unified cinematic universe in which every Marvel superhero can play in is a step in the right direction. For others, including Logan director James Mangold, there is some concern about what this could mean for their future. If they re actually changing their mandate, if what they re supposed to do alters, that would be sad to me because it just means less movies,  Mangold told Deadline.  The real thing that happens when you make a movie rated R, behind the scenes, is that the studio has to adjust to the reality that there will be no Happy Meals. There will be no action figures. 20th Century Fox found a",

If you haven't taken that same step yet, just wait until you see Kourtney Kardashian's birthday cake for Younes Bendjima. I promise you're gonna fall deeper for them than you ever thought possible.On Friday, May 4, the mom-of-three brought Bendjima on a private jet to celebrate his 25th birthday, The Daily Mail reports.

Bendjima was then shown happily dancing around his birthday cake to Jagged Edge's gleeful banger, \"Where the Party At,\" before blowing out the candles.

However, her four-year romance with Jamie was not a secret for Tom, who has known about the couple for some time and is not a fan.Katie, 38, started dating Jamie, 49, shortly after her divorce from Tom, 55, in 2012 but it wasn't until this week that photos finally surfaced of the couple holding hands while walking on the beach. Tom, on his part, feels stabbed in the back by his former Collateral co-star.A post shared by Fameolous (@fameolous__) on Apr 3, 2017 at 11:45am PDT Tom has known about Katie and Jamie s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up. While Katie and Jamie did their best to keep things a secret from the world, Tom is too well-connected and found out about them shortly after their romance began,  a source told Hollywood Life. \"Tom is shocked and upset that Katie is dating a costar he once considered a close friend. He feels betrayed by both of them.\"The timing is no coincidence when it comes to Katie's decision to publicize her romance. According to reports, her divorce contained a clause that did not allow her to publicly date another man for five years after their split.\"Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce,  a source said.  She s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter Suri.\"And the couple is getting serious. Jamie was spotted hanging out Suri, Katie's 11-year-old daughter",

    "text": "There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that  Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There s an intense connection between them! An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin   Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old  X-Men  co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.",

    "title": "Box Office: Why 'Fifty Shades Freed' Is Already A Huge Hit",
    "text": "At this point in time, the whole  teaser for the trailer  thing is so normalized that it is no longer surprising. But there are two interesting bits right off the bat about this Fifty Shades Freed teaser. First, at 66 seconds, it s damn well long enough to be the full trailer. At this point, you re either in or you re out concerning this third film in E.L. James  bondage-flavored romantic drama. Aside from maybe Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I can t think of a movie that needs less of an actual marketing campaign, at least in terms of spoiler-y footage.Second, it teases the actual theatrical trailer for November, meaning this is a two-months  early sneak peak of said trailer. That may be a something of a record. Sony dropped a Ghostbusters trailer teaser on Feb. 14, 2016 in advance of its March 3, 2016 trailer launch, but I can t think of any movie that debuted their trailer teaser two months in advance. I can only assume we ll see the trailer attached to STX Entertainment s A Bad Moms Christmas unless Universal/Comcast Corp. feels like being funny and attaching it to Sony s The Star. As for the actual teaser, the footage is at least somewhat promising a bit kinky sex than we had the last time out. So at least this time fans might get what they paid for.Fifty Shades Darker was essentially about how Anastasia Steele (still a great name for a 007 villain) molded Mr. Grey into  husband material,  which meant a lot more conventional sex but a lot less kink. Also of note, we get more conventional violence this time out, including a guy who I presume is Steele s former boss holding a knife to her throat. So for those who want rescue fantasies with their BDSM, there you go.Twenty",

The 52-year-old Biggest Loser trainer recounts the dizzy spells he had been experiencing weeks prior to collapsing at a New York City gym on that fateful day.  What I should have done was seen a doctor immediately,  he says.  I m a workout nut, so I m used to being uncomfortable, I m used to being in pain.

    "text": "The Big Three turned 37 and a major piece fell into place regarding Jack s death, but the Season 2 premiere succeeded because it didn t try to recreate the past.[Editor s Note: The following review contains spoilers for the  This Is Us  Season 2 premiere, Episode 1,  My Father s Advice. ]When  This Is Us  premiered, it not only took the nation by storm, but quickly established a reputation for being a twist-driven family drama. The pilot pulled off a major last-second reveal   that Randall (Sterling K. Brown), Kate (Chrissy Metz), and Kevin (Justin Hartley) were all children of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore)   and permanently hooked an audience who was already wooed by the emotional melodrama driving each individual story. With each new episode came the expectation for another twist, another secret, another layer to be revealed.But as the season progressed, that expectation grew tiring. The characters were so full of life, the plots didn t need to depend on any flashback reveals or present-day shocks. The best episodes played out naturally, like  Memphis,  when Randall s biological father passed away during a road trip to his hometown. Viewers came to understand William s (Ron Cephas Jones, who made a nice cameo in the Season 2 premiere) backstory, but it wasn t shared to pull the rug out from the present; just to enhance it.The Season 2 premiere arrived Tuesday night, for better or worse, with light pressure to recreate the magic from Season 1   including the final twist   but there s only one big question left: How did Jack die? We ve known he passed away when the kids were young for a long time, and the persistent query has been pushed again and again by fans and the media. Though Episode 1 didn t answer the big question in its entirety,  This",

    "text": "Atlanta burst onto the television scene in 2016, captivating audiences and winning awards left and right. So how do you top that in season two? If Donald Glover has anything to say about it: Tiny Toon Adventures. Seriously.The Emmy-winning co-creator and star revealed that he was largely inspired by the 1992 direct-to-video animated film, Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, which followed the younger versions of the iconic Looney Tunes characters during their summer vacation from school. It later aired on TV as four separate episodes. In the writers  room, we talked about [How I Spent My Vacation] by Tiny Toons. That was the inspiration for season two,  Donald revealed at FX s Television Critics Association press tour on Friday to laughter, adding at one point that it was one of his favorite childhood TV shows.Added executive producer and writer Stephen Glover:  We kind of took that idea of a whole story, but being told in a bunch of different parts that could maybe seem like they re their own thing but they all are one.   You enjoy them more when they're together, but you can also enjoy them in bits,  Donald said.The Atlanta team insisted that they didn t rely on what worked successfully in season one in planning out the upcoming episodes, which they're calling Atlanta Robbin' Season. We didn t really look back at season one for inspiration as much. I feel like if you do that as a producer of television, you tend to be risk averse, which I think is bad for art,  Donald said.  What are the things that will make people happy? We just tried to be ourselves. Producer and director Hiro Murai pointed to the season s unique title as a palette cleanser of sorts.  The title is setting up the audience to approach the show differently,  he",

    "title": "Is Bradley Cooper Really Singing in A Star Is Born?",
    "text": "Bradley Cooper is set to make his directorial debut in A Star Is Born alongside Lady Gaga later this year. The musical, a remake of the 1970s drama starring Barbra Streisand (also a remake of the 1937 and 1954 versions) chronicles the life of a small-town girl who moves to the big city to become a star. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a has-been rock singer, to Gaga's Ally, the talented small-town girl in question. The plot will likely stay true to the original, showcasing the pitfalls and inevitable romance between Jackson and Ally along her rise to stardom.Cooper recently opened up about his experience shooting the film, telling Vulture, \"[Gaga] said right from the beginning that there would be a barter. [She said] 'I'm gonna rely on you to get a performance that's honest out of me' [...] 'and I'm gonna make sure that you're going to turn into a musician. Because we're going to sing everything live.' And I went, 'Wait, what?'\"That's correct: Bradley Cooper will be singing live in the movie! Gaga reportedly told the 43-year-old actor that she wasn't a fan of movie stars lip-syncing to a prerecorded song in films. \"She's right!\" he agreed. \"[Singing live] was terrifying, and I really relied on her. I spent about a year and a half taking vocal lessons and preparing.\" Even though the movie took only 42 days to shoot, Cooper revealed it took three years for him to fully get into character.ADVERTISEMENT\"The broken love story in A Star Is Born kept haunting me. Shots kept coming into my head. I would dream about it. I realized I had to [direct it], whether it fails or not,\" he shared. \"I knew I had to try, and I wound up absolutely loving it.

    "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Is a Master Class in PR Spins",
    "text": "There have been plenty of celebrity breakups recently, but none have been so carefully analyzed as the Pitt-Jolie separation. Each bit of information that reaches the media is being treated like a chess move in a big game of Who Gets to Keep Their Reputation.Angelina Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged altercation between Brad Pitt and their son Maddox on a private plane. The only info that we, the reading public had at first was that she cited irreconcilable differences, and was trying to get sole custody of their children. Wanting sole custody seemed significant, even before reports of Pitt s drinking began to surface.Now that Marion Cotillard has denied any involvement in the separation, the media focus is more and more on how Pitt interacts with his children. Is he a man who drinks and emotionally or physically abuses his family when intoxicated? Or is Angelina Jolie exaggerating one family argument so she can get custody, then jet off to the U.N., as the Pitt camp alleges? It all kind of hinges on some recorded evidence of the inciting incident that supposedly led to Jolie s filing.Lainey Gossip devoted a long blog Friday to the way in which Brad Pitt has been trying to set up the video of his argument with Jolie and Maddox, a video that has not yet been released, but likely will judging from the way Pitt s PR is trying to lay the groundwork. She points out that Pitt s team has clearly chosen People as their tabloid of choice, and in a post literally titled  Brad s Side of the Story  they have carefully crafted how we should read the abuse allegations. As Lainey writes:You know what s interesting though? PEOPLE s version of  Brad s side of the story  has been amended. The one that s up on the site",

The comment and typo were saved thanks to growing Instagram account, @CommentsByCelebs, which tracks the most notable comments that celebrities leave on each other's photos.Kim has yet to respond to Tyga's comment, but she did alter her caption to correctly spell the Japanese city. Of course, Kylie is now dating Travis Scott, who she started dating shortly before she became pregnant with her first child, Stormi Webster.It's curious that Tyga would randomly call out his ex-girlfriend's sister on such a public platform -- surely he knew that the comment would get picked up.

The money is to be used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park.[10]With the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools' Day joke,[11][12][13] and",

Heather Locklear was everything and she was one of the biggest starts of that time. But things have not been smooth sailing for Locklear as of late.  It s sad whatever demons she s dealing with,  Andy says.Of course Andy is referring to Locklear s brush with the law that happened earlier this year. In February, People reported that the  90s icon was arrested on suspicion of domestic battery against her then-boyfriend, Chris Heisser, and three counts of battery on a police officer.Reportedly, Locklear started the altercation when she threw a Red Bull can at Heisser because she felt that he had  lied to her.  She told police officers that Heisser had then tried to strangle her in retaliation, and while these validity of these claims proved to be inconclusive, (Heisser denies these claims, saying  I never touched her ), police did find blood on the bridge of Heisser s nose and red marks across his chest.

The song was produced by Mr. Porter and built around a sample of Cheech & Chong s rock pastiche,  Earache My Eye. Feels like we re stuck in a time warp to me/ As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions/ As this beat backspins/ It like we re drifting back into the Sixties/ Having black skin is risky  cause this keeps happening,  Eminem says.  Throughout history, African Americans have been treated like shit/ And I admit, there have been times where it s been embarrassing to be a white boy. In the third verse of  Untouchable,  after the energetic Cheech & Chong sample subsides, Eminem delivers a sprawling narrative from the perspective of the black community    Why is there black neighborhoods?/  Cause America segregated us/ Designated us to an area/ Separated us/ Section-eight d us    and criticized bad cops who  fuck it up for good cops. Just keep marching, til  we reach Congress/ But they gonna say you re tying to take an irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag/ But somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb,  Eminem said.  So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum if you don t stand for the national anthem. In addition to  Untouchable,  Eminem also unveiled the album cover for Revival, with the rapper ruefully burying his head in his hand behind an unfurled American flag. Revival, due out December 15th, features guests like Ed Sheeran, Pink and Alicia Keys as well as  Walk on Water  collaborator Beyonce.The best from the bloody, bombastic, brilliant career of the hip-hop troublemaker.

    "text": "Whether you want to see Jon and Dany win it all, or you re putting your money on Arya and her hit list, Game of Thrones fans have a hard time agreeing who should ultimately get the Iron Throne.But one study might just have the answer at least, the scientific answer for who should actually rule the Seven Kingdoms. In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of noble birth, female and flexible about loyalty were the strongest characteristics for surviving to the end. Sounds like we have a Daenerys Targaryen on the throne, then (although, she doesn t see herself there, apparently). Noble? Check. Female? Check. Wavering loyalty to the masters of Astapor who she had killed? Check.Other possibilities: Cersei Lannister, who is also noble, female and of wavering loyalty when it serves her best (#TBT to the High Sparrow). Sansa Stark is also in the running if we re going off this study, since she was  loyal  to the Lannisters when she married Joffrey.The (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were nobles died at a lower rate than commoners, and women died at a lower rate than men. Also, switching allegiances, like the character of Tyrion Lannister does by siding with Dany, was another good strategy for outlasting rivals.Just an excuse for the team to rewatch all seven seasons? Possibly. More fuel for our group chat debate? Definitely.RELATED: These  Game of Thrones  Scripts Might Have Just Confirmed a *Major* Fan Theory About the Old Cersei Prophecy",

Even better, Fergie s son Axl sings in French on the catchy track released Sept. 22! Prepare to be wowed!While Fergie s, 42, new album Double Dutchess is full of sure-to-be hits, one of her coolest tracks to date is her song  Enchant  (Carine).  The singer dropped the highly anticipated music video for the single today, starring none other than Kendall Jenner, 21. The model channels Sleeping Beauty while waking up from a snooze, serving up all sorts of fierceness while debuting a plethora of glamorous looks. Fergie s song adorably features vocals by her and Josh Duhamel s, 44, four-year-old son Axl Jack Duhamel. And not only does little Axl sing his heart out not once, but twice on the catchy track, he sings in a different language! Axl starts the entire song off with a bang by sweetly singing in French, and his cute little voice has totally melted our hearts. Click here to see pics from Fergie s  Like It Ain t Nuttin  music video.Axl sings the below lyrics, which loosely translate to:  Nice to meet you, it s very nice.  And while we know the youngster s only four, he sounds pretty darn good! Maybe we ve got a future singer on our hands? Fergie s little boy begins the song and then repeats his part about halfway through the track.

She recently went on a humanitarian trip to Iraq, has been filming Maleficent 2, and even took her children to Wicked on London's West End. Gossip Cop can also confirm she's made no effort towards reconciling with Pitt.It should also be noted that this same tabloid falsely claimed Jolie and Pitt were getting back together in June.

According to CelebrityNetWorth.com, Chip and Joanna Gaines are each worth $8 million. A big chunk of their net worth obviously comes from Fixer Upper, which reportedly earns them $30,000 an episode from homeowners seeking renovations, plus an undisclosed fee from HGTV. But the Gaines  have far more revenue sources adding to their net worth to boot.The Magnolia umbrella includes Magnolia Homes, the couple s renovation business; Magnolia Realty, a real estate agency selling homes throughout Texas in cities like Waco, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, Houston and San Antonio; Magnolia Silos, a boutique marketplace in Waco selling home decor and food truck-cuisine; the Magnolia Journal, a quarterly magazine that reportedly boasts 700,000 subscribers paying $20 a year; and last, but not least, the Magnolia House and soon-to-open Hillcrest Estate, luxury rental properties that fetch at least $600 a night.That s not to mention the Gaines  book deals, which were likely lucrative given their celebrity status.

The Oscar-nominated actress recently took to Twitter to slam her Good Will Hunting co-star about his recent comments about sexual assault.In the wake of the deluge of sexual misconduct accusations involving Harvey Weinstein and Ben Affleck, two men who Damon has worked closely with, the Downsizing actor spoke to Peter Travers on ABC on Thursday about the cloud of allegations hovering over Hollywood. He pointed out that the men being accused are being put into  one big bucket  and then said that there is a  spectrum of behavior. You know, there s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?  he said in the interview.  Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn t be conflated, right? When Driver received word of his comments, she took to Twitter saying,  God God, SERIOUSLY?  From there, she did not hold back and continued to drag Damon and other men who share the same opinions. Gosh it s so interesting how men with all these opinions about women s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem (profoundly unsurprising),  she tweeted.Gosh it s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising)   Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017This was followed by an enormous amount of support from other women.

While I love checking out the themed fashion, there are often events outside of the clothes that make the event memorable. Remember elevatorgate? Yep, that happened after the 2014 Met Gala. At the 2016 event, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston spent the night dancing together, and a summer fling followed that set the internet on fire. Now that a year has passed since that night of dancing, I wonder: Are Swift and Hiddleston still friends?Before we get to that, let's do a quick recap of the history of their romance. According to Hiddleston, in an interview with the Press Association, he and Swift were seated at the same table during the 2016 Met Ball. She was there sans her boyfriend at the time, Calvin Harris, but asked Hiddleston for a friendly dance, which was eventually recorded and spread around the internet. About a month following the Met Gala, Harris and Swift announced their breakup. Then, in mid-June, photos of Hiddleston and Swift cuddling on a beach in Rhode Island were released and fans went wild.After a whirlwind summer that included travels all over the world, Hiddles and Swift broke up around Labor Day 2016, the timing which was pretty much the textbook definition of a summer romance.Now that it's been several months, what is Swift and Hiddleston's status? Based on what Hiddleston has shared about their romance, it sounds like there are fond memories and that they are still friendly, but not incredibly close, which is understandable.In February 2017, Hiddleston opened up about Swift in a GQ profile. His first comment on her was just overwhelmingly sweet and he said, Taylor",

    "text": "It's finally here, people: Taylor Swift 's sixth studio album, Reputation . And it was well worth the wait because the record is good, plain and simple a delectable collection of techno-heavy bops with poignant, petty, and wildly romantic lyrics. Like all Swift albums, though, fans will most likely care more about the words to these songs than the sonics.So that's where we come in: We went ahead and scoured Swift's new album for all the Joe Alwyn, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and Kimye references and there are a ton of 'em. Swift isn't playing games this time around, and we love her for it. Dig in.Joe Alwyn\"Delicate\" : This song is one of many odes to Alwyn on this album. She references his blue eyes (\"Damn, never seen that color blue\"), the women in England (\"Do the girls back home touch you like I do?\"), and the brevity of their relationship (\"Is it too soon to do this yet?\").\"Dress\" : \"Flashback to when you met me / Your buzz cut / And my hair bleached,\" Swift reveals toward the end of this song. Alwyn had a buzzcut while filming Billy Lynn's Halftime Walk , and Swift had bleached-blond hair for the first half of 2016. The \"gold tattoo\" reference could also be a nod to Alwyn's golden blond hair.\"Don't Blame Me\" : There's no specific references, but this entire song discusses how Swift's \"drug\" is her \"baby,\" so it's obvious who this is about.\"King of My Heart\" : The \"king\" in this song is not American, because Swift says she's his \"American queen.\" She also says this king \"fancies\" her, which is a British term. And we don't have to remind you that Alwyn is British.\"Gorgeous\" : \"Gorgeous\" is perhaps the most obvious tribute to Alwyn on the record. It includes",

    "text": "Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the Marchesa fashion line, saw her label soar to prominence and profits thanks in some measure to Harvey Weinstein, the rich and powerful movie mogul she married in 2007.Now that Weinstein has become a pariah, engulfed in allegations of sexual harassment from well over a dozen women including famous actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGowan, and Ashley Judd, it s widely believed that Chapman s Marchesa label will suffer a dramatic fall at least in Hollywood circles. No star is ever going to want to wear the brand again,  one publicist told the Hollywood Reporter.Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman attend a Broadway show in New York in late 2015. Walter McBride WireImageThat publicist asked to remain anonymous, and indeed, few sources will speak on the record or make any comment at all about Weinstein, Chapman, or Marchesa. It seems that the Weinstein scandal is so toxic that retailers, Hollywood insiders, and pros in the fashion business don t want to be linked to it in any way.In statements, Weinstein has said that has  behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain.  He officially resigned from the production firm he co-founded, the Weinstein Company, this week, and is believed to be seeking treatment in Arizona. A Weinstein spokesperson also said that  any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,  and  there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Here s what we know about what Weinstein has meant for Chapman and her Marchesa label and how Chapman s business interests and net worth could be impacted by the revelations about her husband.Georgina Chapman s Net Worth Before Her Split from Harvey WeinsteinRight after the first sexual misconduct allegations surfaced earlier this month, Weinstein said his wife was  100 percent behind me.

    "text": "Like Troy, Daniel could be a staple in the show s flashbacks. If the showrunners  intent is to explore what happened during the time jump we never saw during Season 4, bringing Daniel back makes perfect sense. Of course, that poses another tricky question. Daniel and Nick, presumably, made it out of the dam together as it crumbled; if that s indeed the case, how will Daniel s story be told without Nick? Could the flashbacks move further forward in time to avoid that complication?Season 4 ended with Team Morgan vowing to take in those who needed help in Texas, largely through looking back at Al s tapes. In theory, ifopts for another time jump, Season 5 could start with Daniel already at the factory, settled into a new life. There s only one problem with this   it would require him to set aside his bad blood with Strand.Much like Troy could be trying to get revenge on the Clark family for what Madison did to him, Daniel could be after vengeance for the dam. Undoubtedly, he blames Strand for Lola and Ephrain s deaths and the demise of the sanctuary the dam had become   and that nasty gunshot wound to his cheek. It would be in-character for Daniel to have not forgiven or forgotten, and even before Season 3, he and Strand were on shaky footing. It would be neat to see the saga of Strand and Daniel continue to unfold in Season 5.This could also be likely to happen, though it d be disappointing. Fans had been hoping to see Daniel come back throughout last season, and if the only glimpse they get of him is on Al s camera, it could impede him serving a meaningful role in the story going forward. Since Al talked to Madison, it s not impossible that Daniel might",

    "title": "Gwen Stefani Calls Off Her Wedding To Blake Shelton,  The Voice s  Chloe Kohanski To Blame?",
    "text": "A new report claims that Gwen Stefani has called off her wedding to Blake Shelton after months of planning the June ceremony. The mother-of-three began to panic about Shelton s possible infidelity, and it resulted in a huge fight, with Stefani ultimately deciding the two shouldn t tie the knot. Could there be any truth to the story?Life & Style is claiming that Stefani was not happy with how close Shelton had become with Chloe Kohanski, his 24-year-old team member on The Voice. Their student-teacher relationship unnerved the No Doubt singer, and after Kohanski won the show, Stefani decided to confront Shelton   and that s when the fight and wedding cancellation happened.It makes sense that Stefani would be insecure about cheating since her 13-year marriage to Gavin Rossdale ended when he had an affair with their nanny. It seems unlikely that Shelton would cheat, but just the thoughts of infidelity are enough for Stefani to call off their planned nuptials.Sources claim the couple is still together and they will get married someday, but right now the couple is working on their issues. The last thing either of them wants is another divorce.Stefani and Shelton met on the set of the NBC reality singing competition and began dating in 2015 after Stefani divorced Rossdale and Shelton ended his marriage to Miranda Lambert.But, could any of this actually be true? Or, is it just another false story from a tabloid? According to Gossip Cop, it s the latter.The rumor-busting website says that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski, and Stefani s rep told them that reports of a wedding being called off are simply untrue. The couple isn t anywhere near a split, and their relationship is not  on the rocks. The truth about Stefani and Shelton is that they are happy and spent time",

But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.

In addition to the age difference   the 12 celebrity kids range from 9 to 14 years old   the other variation is that Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, so the kids were out of school and so that many of our favorite pro dancers could serve as mentors, among them Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev. The judging panel also has fresh faces and is comprised of Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon. It is a true black hole of love, warmth and genuinely rooting for each other,  Fisher says of the DTWS family.

(Um, yeah, it s usually Paula for both of those.)However, The Ashley is often asked by readers how things worked on  The Challenge  so she set out to find answers to your burning questions about the show. After a lot of research, The Ashley has finally managed to get some inside info on what it s like to be on this show!Q: How did MTV get the idea for  The Challenge? A: According to Wikipedia, it all started back in the late-1990s when the casts of  The Real World: Boston  and  Road Rules: Islands  met while the  Real World  cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The intensely competitive challenge brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce yet another spin-off series. Q: How long does the Challenge actually last? How long are they in the house if they make it to the end?A: Cast member Katie Doyle has said many times on her twitter that those crazy kids are stuck in the house for about six weeks while filming, if they make it to the end.Q: Does MTV foot the bill when the cast mates go out on the town during the Challenges?A:  Battle of the Exes  cast member Priscilla Mendez told US Davis  newspaper The Auggie that MTV does not pay for the cast s recreational activities, and does not condone underage drinking. Of course, the  Challenges  always take place in foreign countries, and oftentimes it s not illegal to drink in those country if you re under 21. Still, the cast members have to pay for their own",

That s the best time for those intimate conversations, the ones you have at the beginning of a relationship to happen,  the insider said.  Away from home and looking for companionship, it s easy to see what happened. If these two are together, it d be pretty interesting timing considering their divorces from Ben Affleck, 45, and Fergie, 42. Jen and Ben announced they were separating in 2015, after a decade of marriage. They officially filed for divorce in April 2017.  Anyone in Jen s shoes, after all she went through with Ben, would doubt whether they could ever trust a man again,  the source said.  But Josh is truly a good guy, and spending time with him opened her up emotionally. She s still playing her cards close to the vest, but she s excited about where this could go. Josh and Fergie were married for eight years before announcing in Sept. 2017 that they had separated earlier in the year.  To be honest, hardly anyone close to him thought Josh and Fergie made a good couple. She was too wild for him. Josh is a homebody and craves the simple life. With Jen, he d get that in spades.

This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005.

Her pieces have an identity. Jewelry-making was not a lifelong goal for Ms. Meyer, although as a child she did spend afternoons making rings and medallions with her paternal grandmother, Edith Meyer, who designed enamel pieces in a tiny Santa Monica apartment, its kitchen crowded with a kiln. She studied child and family psychology at Syracuse University; when she returned to Los Angeles in 1999, she went straight into the work force, although not exactly by her own choice. I was done with college and my dad said to me,  Here s the deal: You have two weeks to find a job,  she said. She quickly gravitated toward style-related work, first as the West Coast beauty and fitness editor of Glamour and then in the publicity departments of Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren. She was unflappable and she was also humble,  recalled Wanda McDaniel, who hired Ms. Meyer at Armani, where she is executive vice president, entertainment industry communications worldwide.  There s no Hollywood artifice about her at all. She s just a very cool, ambitious, friendly person   and she did work very hard. Rebekah McCabe was Ms. Meyer s boss at Ralph Lauren and now is senior vice president of artistic direction, store design, events and public relations at Chanel.  She doesn t rest on her laurels,  Ms. McCabe said.  There s an innate sense of wanting to do well, wanting to work hard, not take anything for granted and always improving.

    "title": "Should Angelina Jolie Be Concerned About Bulging Veins In Arms & Legs?   Surgeon Speaks",
    "text": "Angelina Jolie is known for her thin appearance with protruding veins on her body, but should those veins be a concern? A vascular surgeon spoke EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife.com about the answer.Angelina Jolie, 42, has seemed to have a thin figure with eye catching bulging veins on her arms and legs, but is it something she should keep an eye on?  The large vein on her forearm is the Accessory cephalic vein,  vascular surgeon, Dr. Larisse K Lee EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com.  Angelina is a physically thin woman, so that s why you re seeing those veins protrude the way they are on her hands and arms. Being that she is a thinner build, when she flexes her muscles that s when those veins are more pronounced and you can see them more. The vein that you re seeing on her leg is the great saphenous vein. It starts at the groin and goes down to the ankle. I don t see anything that would be pause for concern with Angelina.  Well, that s definitely good news! See some photos of Angelina s thin frame here.Dr. Lee also shared what kind of veins would be dangerous.  If her veins were spider-like or if they were bigger bulging veins, then she would need to have those treated, but we typically only see that in larger people and older individuals,  she continued.  For what she is showing, it s not symptomatic. She s just a vascular woman. Angelina and her fit body recently made headlines when she graced the Nov. 2017 cover of Bazaar. The mother of six has been keeping busy since her split from Brad Pitt, 53, and keeps proving she s dedicated to raising her children and staying active in her charitable contributions.HollywoodLifers, what are your thoughts on what the surgeon had to say?

Grandmother Kris Jenner and maternal Aunt Kylie Jenner were also present for this occasion. Dad Kanye West was dressed in a camo while mother Kim was in a white tank top with gray sweats. Daily Mail has reported that the mother of two decided to go braless under the skimpy top. North West, the birthday girl looked cute in her vintage Snoop Dogg tank and fluffy leopard shoes. Little Nori as North West is lovingly called probably had opened the gifts inside the restaurant since she left the place with quite a haul, which included a bicycle. Earlier in the day, the family had rented out Chuck E Cheese s for North and her friends to ring in her birthday.Recalling Nori s first birthday party bashKim Kardashian and Kanye West were newlyweds during their daughter s first birthday party. It was inspired by California s Coachella music festival. In this Kidchella party, there was a Ferris wheel, face-painting as well as a stage for lip-syncing.

While other undercover operatives tend to lay low and draw as little attention to themselves as possible, Garcia used his massive 6-foot 4-inch, 300-pound frame to muscle his way into the ranks of several different crime families and into the circles of corrupt cops, often overlapping his investigations with numerous identities.For more than two years, Garcia posed as \"Jack Falcone,\" an associate to the Gambino crime family of La Cosa Nostra in New York City. His investigation resulted in the conviction of 32 gangsters, including several key members of the family. Concurrently, Garcia posed as a different New York-based mobster and concluded a three-year FBI sting in Florida that brought down four dirty cops.During the same time frames as his New York and Florida operations, Garcia participated in two separate undercover operations in Atlantic City that targeted corrupt politicians and a Boston sting targeting corrupt cops. According to a veteran law enforcement official who worked with him, Garcia is \"the best undercover agent the Bureau has ever had.\"While undercover, Garcia posed as a jewel thief mobster who also sold drugs. He played his part so well members of the gamed Gambino crime family took him in and made him a top member in their administration. In 2008, he released an autobiography which was adapted into a film that as of April 2017 has not been released.",

    "text": "Powered by imdbAn actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face, Golden Globe-winner Brad Pitt's most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Fight Club (1999). However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography. Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\". Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992). But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which",

    "text": "Ever since The Crown bowed on Netflix, fans have been wondering how long it will take the sumptuous period drama to reach the ill-fated marriage of Prince Charles and Diana. Because the show s first season, which starred Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, spanned 1947 and 1955, viewers worried that it would take at least three or four more seasons until the drama catches up to Charles and Diana s 1977 meeting, 1981 wedding, and subsequent marriage. But series creator and writer Peter Morgan has revealed that The Crown will tackle the monarchy-marriage drama sooner than expected.Princess Diana will be introduced toward the end of Season 3, Morgan confirms in a new interview with People, with Seasons 4 and 5  heavily  focused on her as one of the main characters. To facilitate the time jump, the series will recast the major roles with older actors who can better portray Elizabeth, Philip, Charles, etc. as they age.It will be interesting to see how The Crown, which is very much Team Monarchy, approaches the relationship, which began somewhat informally in 1977 when Charles and Diana met through her sister, whom Charles was dating at the time. When Diana became a princess, the world largely sympathized with her a deft manipulator of her public image as opposed to her less-photogenic and less P.R.-savvy husband. But Morgan will likely offer a new, Charles-sympathetic perspective to the royal marriage. In The Queen, for example, Morgan depicted Charles as a responsible and caring father frustrated by the old-fashioned, out-of-touch constraints dictated by the monarchy. And he depicted Diana, at least through Queen Elizabeth s eyes, as a drama-stirring, attention-hogging, trouble-making headache to the family.Before getting to Diana, though, Morgan and Co. are busily filming the show s second season, which will debut in late 2017 and, according to People,  feature a",

    "title": "How Caitlyn Jenner Is Secretly Fighting Trump s White House on Transgender Rights",
    "text": "Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.The world s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill. I don t do a lot of media. I don t want to be seen everywhere,  the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair.  Today, I m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don t stick my nose into everything publicly. Jenner s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show,  I Am Cait. Her newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner   who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner   to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a",

James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are nearing their 20th wedding anniversary this year.ET s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers. I don t know, because nobody trains you,  he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage.  This is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I m a person that believes that if I m wrong, that s when I learn, and when I m right, I haven t learned a thing. Noting that he takes his relationship  day to day,  Brolin revealed that he s an advocate of marriage counseling. I do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!  he said.  Sometimes in a tough marriage, it s tough to talk, but if you do, it works! The 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times. When she s busy, she s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,  he shared.  And if I come to her with something important and she says,  I don t have time right now,  she doesn t have time, period. That s the way the mind works. You gotta focus. As for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said,  I m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes,  Hurry home!  When I get there, there s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate. RELATED CONTENT:Barbra Streisand Calls Out",

    "title": "Top Gun 2 cast: Tom Cruise 'begging' this actress to star in the sequel, but her husband opposes?",
    "text": "Late last year, Tom Cruise confirmed that the 1986 blockbuster will return with a mind-blowing sequel with the actor reprising the iconic Maverick role. The Mission: Impossible 6 star also revealed that the movie's title confirming that Top Gun 2 will adopt the lead character's name in the title. The sequel will be called, Top Gun: Maverick.Following the announcement, no other official announcements regarding the movie's cast or plot were shared thereafter as the actor got involved in wrapping up MI6. With no more official word available, a report by Star claims that Cruise has approached John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston to co-star in the movie. Fans would remember that Preston was Cruise's co-star in Jerry Maguire.Trending: Mission: Impossible 6 trailerBizarrely, the news report associates his request to the actress who is associated with Scientology. A source allegedly claims, \"Tom thinks she's super talented, not to mention sexy\" and wants her in the movie. But Travolta is apparently opposing Cruise's offer because the former resents the fellow Scientologist.\"John's always been jealous of the church giving Tom top billing. Tom already gets whatever he wants, but John draws the line at his wife,\" the insider said.Meanwhile, Gossip Cop claims otherwise. The site reports that there is no tension between the two actors. The website also clarifies that Cruise hasn't even approached Preston about a role in the July 2019 release.While fans wait to watch things unfold, Justin Marks teased the plot of the sequel. The screenwriter, who has penned down the early draft of Maverick, recently told Slash, hinting towards a love angle in the movie.\"Without getting into details, that was something that was important to everyone to avoid, to find something new,\" Marks said. \"I think [Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer] would kill me if I told any specific details.\"He added, \"Here's",

A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a \"lick\" at the victims' apartment.Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace",

Just like with many of his casinos and hotels, President Donald Trump, 70, has decided to take a pre-existing institution and slap his own branding on it, as TMZ reports Trump s changing the name of the month dedicated to celebrating America s finest citizens of color.After Trump met with African American leaders, a senior administration official tells TMZ, Donald was convinced that the term  black  is outdated, and the more appropriate way to refer to the community is  African American.  Hmmm, sounds like Donald s trying to be a little bit more politically correct!Update: Guess what! TMZ has updated their story to point out that yes, most modern presidents have referred to it as  National African American History Month  and Donald did NOT change it.Trump also noticed how the newest addition to the Smithsonian museum was called the  National Museum of African American History and Culture,  the official tells TMZ. So, Trump decided to change the month s name. Ever since 1976, every U.S. president has designated February as  Black History Month,  but Donald has reportedly decided to do his own thing. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for a comment on this report.Donald s sudden interest in African American studies comes one day after his strange behavior regarding Frederick Douglass. The abolitionist, former slave and suffrage advocate was brought up by the ex-Celebrity Apprentice star during a Black History Event on Feb. 1, according to The Atlantic.

    "title": "Katie Holmes-Tom Cruise divorce deal lets her control Suri's upbringing, source says",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES - For Tom Cruise, a quick resolution to his divorce from Katie Holmes looked like  Mission: Impossible  just last week. But the Hollywood action hero appears to have extinguished the tabloid firestorm with an agreement that one source said grants Holmes primary custody of their daughter, Suri, and control of her religious upbringing.The confidential deal was hammered out over the weekend in New York and announced Monday, 11 days after Holmes took the industry and her husband by surprise with the filing of divorce papers in Manhattan. A key issue in the split was the Church of Scientology, of which Cruise is the most prominent member.With a prenuptial agreement governing the distribution of assets, talks between lawyers for Cruise and Holmes, who was raised Roman Catholic, centered on the role of Scientology in the upbringing of 6-year-old Suri, according to the source who was familiar with the negotiations but not authorized to discuss them publicly. The agreement provides Cruise with visitation rights but gives Holmes the lead role in choosing how Suri will be educated, the source said Monday. She is the primary caretaker right now and Tom is the one who primarily goes away on movies. So little will change,  the source said.Holmes initiated divorce proceedings on June 28, reportedly identifying the parties as Anonymous versus Anonymous. Cruise had not yet responded in court when the parties began settlement discussions. The deal avoids a long court battle that could have become a public relations nightmare not only for the 50-year-old  Top Gun  veteran, who has several big-budget movies upcoming, but also for Scientology.Tabloid coverage of the split has portrayed Cruise and Scientology negatively, with headlines such as  Katie Holmes  Felt Like She Was in Rosemary s Baby    and  Katie Free at Last.

    "text": "The 2018 SAG Awards were held last night, and though the focus on the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement wasn t as acute as it was at the Golden Globes, the theme of righting wrongs in Hollywood was very much still there. And coming off the Women s March just a couple days prior, we were all kind of riding that high of female empowerment in the face of adversity.So it was a bit of a letdown to hear Alexander Skarsg rd s acceptance speech when he received his award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries for his role in Big Little Lies. Skarsg rd plays Perry, an abusive husband in the HBO hit series, and in both his SAG Award acceptance speech and his acceptance speech for his Golden Globe he doesn t mention domestic abuse once. While we certainly don t place any of Perry s actions onto the actor, there is some cognitive dissonance in awarding a man for playing an abuser in a time when women are finally feeling emboldened enough to call out those who have abused them in real life, and then for that actor to completely ignore the subject of abuse when he s acknowledged for the role. You can watch his speech to see for yourself.To add insult to injury, Skarsg rd even manages to piss off veteran actor Robert DeNiro in the process, saying,  A lot of people have been talking about who the greatest male actor ever is. Is it Mr. Robert DeNiro, or is it the tall guy from True Blood?  DeNiro was nominated in the same category this year for his work in The Wizard of Lies, and while Skarsg rd probably meant the comment to be a self-deprecating joke, DeNiro didn t seem to find the joke particularly funny.Robert DeNiro clearly must have better places to",

With the release of Taylor Swift s new single,  Look What You Made Me Do,  which blatantly disses Kanye West (and wife Kim Kardashian), the bad blood is at an all time high   at least, on the pop star s end. But rewind back to 2009, and you d get a very different story.Well, at least for Taylor and Kim. That was, of course, the year the drama between the Reputation songstress and Kanye started, when he interrupted her accepting the award for Video of the Year at the MTV VMAs.Eventually, the two made up, but the feud was revived in 2016 when they fought over the rapper rapping  I made that bitch famous  in his song  Famous. Of course, things only got worse after that, as Kim released a video of the phone call Taylor and Kanye had where she gave him permission to use that line.So really, up until last year, there were no hard feelings between the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and singer   and now there s video proof!In a resurfaced interview from 2009, the now-36-year-old reality star gushes about Taylor, calling herself a big fan of her work. I love Taylor Swift, I m the biggest Taylor Swift fan,  the mother of two tells a reporter on the red carpet.She goes on to add that her  number one song  on her iPod   throwback alert!   is Tay s 2008 single,  Love Story.

Friends are worried the 25-year-old is on a downward spiral and actually  is a mess,  a source tells OK! Magazine.Even prior to her breakup, Selena s been very open about struggles she faces, including depression and anxiety, and goes to therapy on a regular basis to work on her battles.And the split, which of course happened in front of the world, didn t help matters. Says the insider,  She went from being on top of the world to dealing with nonstop relationship drama. She feels so demoralized and alone. On top of that, because her mother Mandy doesn t particularly like Justin, Selena reportedly chose to end things because she could not take the burden of having her mom at odds with her.Unfortunately, that choice backfired. The source added,  Selena now feels a lot of resentment toward Mandy about the decision she made, and they re barely speaking. So she s essentially lost the two main influences in her life, which could be a recipe for disaster.What are your thoughts on Selena s spiral? Let us know in the comments section.",

Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women s issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar No s Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO s just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi s Enoch  Nucky  Thompson, had earned her critical praise.One night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King s Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta s account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink.  Things got very uncomfortable very fast,  the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in",

He and Sofia [Richie] are happy where they are now and they re simply doing their own thing, and Scott and Kourtney are coparenting their kids as they have been with great success.

He has Sofia and doesn t want to be bothered with any drama. Us confirmed on Tuesday, August 7, that Kardashian, 39, and Bendjima broke up the same day photos surfaced of the 26-year-old model with another woman in Mexico. He denied being unfaithful, though the reality star s sisters, Kim Kardashian and Khlo  Kardashian, called him out on social media on Tuesday.

So when Kanye returned to Twitter on April 13th, fans were intrigued especially because he also announced he s releasing not one, but two new albums in June.It certainly seems like Kanye has been hard at work on new music, as many of his tweets discuss his creative process and give insight into his innermost thoughts. And while that s all fantastic, we personally love seeing Kanye in dad mode, especially when he and wife Kim Kardashian share photos of their three beautiful babies.And it looks like four-year-old daughter North is just like any other kid. She plays with her cousins, sometimes has trouble sharing with her brother, and plays with dolls dolls shaped like her dad.Let s backtrack.On April 24th, Kanye tweeted a photo of a Michael Jackson doll alongside a doll that looks surprisingly like him (at least in terms of wardrobe) and captioned it  me and Mike. falseShould it shock any of us that Kanye has a doll of his own likeness? Nah, but his next photo shows that North loves playing with it, which is cute and strange and wonderful in so many ways we didn t even know existed. It also looks like the two had a daddy-daughter dance party to MJ that same morning, and #FOMO alert.falseEagle-eyed fans pointed out that the doll is not, in fact, actually modeled after Kanye, but is instead a Ken Fashionista Barbie doll, which is pretty fitting for Yeezy, who s a force to be reckoned with in the fashion world.

That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former  Dawson s Creek  actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio s birthday party in November, the site alleges.So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her  Django Unchained  boyfriend they needed to break up. Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,  a source told RadarOnline.  Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie s behavior. She knew it wasn t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both. At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn t see her. Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn t see Suri, he didn t question it,  an insider told the Star.  But Tom s tired of being bossed around by them.",

    "text": "Beyonce is completely unbothered by Wendy Williams  auto-tone diss, and we ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she wants to challenge the talk show host to a sing-off.Wendy Williams certainly should have thought twice before coming for Beyonce, 36. After hearing Wendy slam her vocal skills on Feb. 20, Queen Bey is ready to set the record straight.  If Beyonce really worried about what Wendy Williams said then Beyonce would not be Beyonce. She is so far above that chatter. She just had to laugh it off. But, if Wendy ever wanted to put her money where her mouth is she would welcome a sing-off between the two to show who can really sing, and who is just a big bag of hot air!  a source close to Bey tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. If Beyonce and Wendy were to battle it out, we think Yonce would have an unfair advantage. After all, the  Run The World  singer has 20 Grammy Awards, and has been on the music scene for over a decade. She s a pretty intimidating musician to go up against, right?But, before Beyonce could even defend herself, the Bey Hive came to her rescue. A lot of angry fans took to Twitter to unleash their wrath on Wendy.  Why would Wendy Williams EVER come for the queen like that,  one user tweeted.  Beyonce NEEDS auto tune?! Where? Are you dumb?!  another fan said angrily. But for all of you loyal fans out there, Beyonce wasn t the only artist on Wendy s auto-tune list.  There are only a few people who can sing raw-dog and Fergie is not one, she needs auto-tune. Jen[nifer] Lopez needs auto-tune and Janet [Jackson] need auto-tune,  Wendy explained to her audience. Wendy s harsh words came after Fergie delivered a shocking rendition of the U.S. national anthem at the",

Doherty s opinion is nuanced and complex; she isn t simply pro- or anti-reboot. Based on her tweets, she s intrigued and curious about the new project, and doesn t want to be negative about it   she even defends the idea of a reboot in general   yet strongly agrees with some fans who object to the network s description of the project as  feminist reboot  of the original series (when the 1998-2006 series was considered feminist too).Getty ImagesFirst, on the very idea of a reboot:Im intrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted, inspired like all you were. Charmed helped us all in some way   Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018And notes that it will mean more lead roles for women Exactly. More great roles for women. That s a huge plus.   Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018Likewise, while some have slammed the idea of bringing back Charmed as unoriginal, The WB series actually followed 1996 s similarly premised film The Craft and the 1995 book Practical Magic (which released a film version the same year Charmed hit the air). So at one point, the original Charmed was likewise considered by some to be a knock-off I get that but I can tell you that we were inspired by practical magic.

    "text": "Pinterest Nathan Congleton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty ImagesA rare look inside the network's culture of silence.Former Fox News talking head and current sad old creep Bill O'Reilly left the network earlier this year after an avalanche of sexual harassment allegations caused advertisers to flee his stupid show en masse. Over the weekend, the New York Times published a report revealing that O'Reilly had settled with an accuser for an astonishing $32 million shortly before the upstanding citizens at Fox News signed him to a $100 million contract extension in February a decision, one would presume, that it came to regret a few months later.O'Reilly, as usual, remains very, very mad about all of this. He continues to assert that no women complained about him during the entirety of his twenty-year tenure, and he punctuated his interview with the Times with things like \"This is horrible!\" and \"This is crap!\" and other normal things that well-balanced people say when they definitely didn't do the horrible things they've been accused of doing. On Monday, Megyn Kelly, a former O'Reilly colleague who left in January for NBC, went on the air to dispute his claims, reading from evidence obtained from a source she knows well: herself.Kelly was one of the highest-profile alleged harassment victims of the late Roger Ailes, the former Fox News CEO who abruptly left the network in July 2016. (Sorry, keeping track of the men at Fox News who have resigned in disgrace amidst similar-sounding scandals is admittedly a challenging task.) During a November interview, a visibly incensed O'Reilly dismissed Kelly's accusations against Ailes by stating that he was \"not interested\" in \"litigating something... that makes my network look bad.\" In response, Kelly says she wrote to Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernathy, criticizing O'Reilly for \"shaming women into",

    "title": "Justin Bieber Doesn't Attend Grammys 2017 and Eats Sushi Instead",
    "text": "Despite earning four nominations for his album Purpose, Justin Bieber had no plans to attend the Grammy awards this year. Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it's like to have dinner with Justin.)Of course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin \"doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.\"Regardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.However, this wasn't the only questionable act that went down on Justin's Instagram Live feed this weeknd. He also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, \"Favorite song at the moment?\" He pauses, and then replies: \"'Starboy,' by The Weeknd,\" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. You then hear the second voice in the video say:  We ve gotta end it now. That was too funny. But we beg to differ, especially as it's not the first time Justin's taken a swipe at his fellow artist   and it's that consistency that is concerning. This past January, he called The Weeknd's music \"whack,\" so we already knew he wasn't exactly a fan. It's a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex. As we all know, Selena Gomez has been spotted with The Weeknd , and though their relationship hasn't been officially confirmed, there's enough evidence",

None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy TeefeyDuring their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.'They have their own issues and are always on and off.

He told dignitaries including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that as older generations were fading away, it was up to him and other younger people to carry on the commemoration of the Holocaust. I am well aware that the responsibility falls now to my generation to keep the memory alive of that great crime as the Holocaust generation passes on. And I commit myself to doing this. After a brief opening greeting in Hebrew, William added:  Israel s remarkable story is partly one of remembering its terrible past but also looking forward to a much more hopeful future ... the modern story is one of inventing, creating, innovating and striding confidently into its future. Earlier in Jerusalem, he met Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. On Wednesday he will meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.Following his engagements in Jerusalem, William went to Tel Aviv and, sporting sunglasses and an open-necked shirt, strolled along the Mediterranean shore, chatting with beach-goers and quipping,  I should have brought my swimming trunks .William s trip is at the behest of the British government.

And her husband Jonathan Fatu, known to fans as Jimmy Uso, has been there for most of the way as she transformed from former Orlando Magic dancer into pro-wrestling champion. Their relationship continues to be chronicled on the E! reality show Total Divas. Where we were in our lives 10 years ago is a lot different than where we are now,  Naomi, real name Trinity, said.  We were a lot younger, way more immature. Life is different. Our careers have picked up. We got married. We re home owners now. I m full-on, hands-on with my step kids now, which I love. We re truly adulting. The  Feel the Glow  personality has gotten used to the cameras, even when she butts heads with her fellow WWE spouse. In recent episodes of Season 8, Naomi is missing family in Atlanta and wants to spend time with Jon outside of Pensacola. This leads to some uneasy marital discussions. Everything that comes with our lifestyle now is not going to be perfect and easy all the time,  she said.  We re trying to understand each other s wants and needs at this point in our life because we have both changed as people. That s what I m learning and what we are trying to figure out in our marriage right now.\"You re getting to see that unfold on Total Divas. It s real, what is going on and where we are. Hopefully, it can help out other couples and others who are watching can relate because they are going through similar situations. What we put out is real, and what we put out is with no regrets. It s very important to see that as much as we love each other, there are flaws. It s a constant fight to get through",

Their relationship had flourished in private since they first met in July of that year, but when the eyes of the world turned to the prince and his potential bride-to-be, the couple was forced to work hard for their peace and quiet.OCTOBER 2016Like his brother, Harry enjoyed outfoxing the media, and while he was disappointed the story had broken, he knew he was lucky to have enjoyed several months getting to know Meghan without press scrutiny. When the story broke, Harry happened to be with Meghan in Toronto. He was apparently taken by surprise when his aides called to tell him the story was going to be front-page news and knew that very soon he and Meghan would be under siege. A story was leaked that Harry had canceled a flight to Toronto to try and make it look like he was in the U.K., but photographers and reporters descended on Meghan s home regardless.When Meghan suggested they go to stay with her friends Ben and Jessica Mulroney, Harry agreed. The Mulroneys were two of the few friends who knew about the romance, and they were more than happy to let the couple take shelter from the paparazzi at their Toronto house. Jessica, a stylist, is one of Meghan s best friends, while Ben is a TV host who presents CTV s entertainment news",

This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye  plan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.\"Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the \"Netflix and Chill Act?\" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public",

Caitlyn Jenner, 68, all but called her daughters Kendall Jenner, 22, and Kylie Jenner, 20, a burden all while essentially disowning the rest of the Kardashians. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, 52, on the show Life Stories, Caitlyn said,  I don t talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Caitlyn just summarize her role as a parent as hauling around Kylie and Kendall for over two decades? That s a little  harsh.We reported earlier how Caitlyn also told Piers that she didn t trust the Kardashians, especially when it came to keeping her gender reassignment surgery a secret. She said,  It s none of their businesses. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, OK? I didn t want them to leak it to the press, OK? There was no reason for them to know about it, of course I didn t trust them.  Apparently, this was the justification for her leaving the last few pages that detailed her gender reassignment surgery out of her autobiography The Secrets of My Life in a draft she sent to the Kardashians.In less contentious news, Caitlyn s dog Bertha who had gone missing after the roof of Caitlyn s home had been ripped off during the severe winds that struck Southern California in December was triumphantly found the very next day.

Despite experiencing their fair share of ups and downs, the A-list couple is in it for the long haul. When you see them together, there is no doubt about it. They still have crazy passion and love for each other,  a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly, noting that the pair s secret to success is  always making time for each other. Although the Wonder star, 50, and the cinematographer, 49, have faced challenges throughout their relationship, they always  come out on the other side very much together,  adds the insider.  They have a really solid, loving marriage. Their strong bond has helped them remain a united front for their three children, twins Hazel and Phinaeus, 13, and Henry, 10. The duo, who are very  hands-on parents,  the source says, love their  simple, laid-back life in Malibu, attending school functions and community events. 9 PHOTOS Julia Roberts and Danny Moder together See Gallery Julia Roberts and Danny Moder together BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 11: Danny Moder and Julia Roberts attend the 3rd annual Sean Penn & Friends HELP HAITI HOME Gala benefiting J/P HRO presented by Giorgio Armani at Montage Beverly Hills on January 11, 2014 in Beverly Hills, California.

Wait  that s Greg?Friday s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend fall finale brought back Rebecca s former flame Greg for the first time since Season 2   but now he s played by Pitch Perfect star Skylar Astin, who steps in for original cast member Santino Fontana. In true Crazy Ex fashion, the episode leaned into the absurdity of it all, with Rebecca not recognizing Greg at first, making the recast a statement on how radically our perceptions of people can change over time. (He s not even the same person!)Rebecca and Greg started fresh with a get-to-know-you duet    Hello, nice to meet you/You ve been inside of me,  she sang   and even after she confessed to sleeping with Greg s dad, the two didn t totally shut the door on a possible rekindling. With yet another love interest now in Rebecca s orbit, TVLine reached out to showrunner Aline Brosh McKenna to get the scoop on the big Greg recasting, what his return means for Rebecca s already complicated love life   and what we can expect to see in the back half of the final season.TVLINE | We haven t seen Greg since way back in Season 2. When did you first decide he had to come back, in some form?Well, we had always thought their love relationship would die somewhere during Season 2, but we were going to continue his journey towards figuring out that he was an alcoholic, and towards sobriety. We probably would ve taken all of Season 2 to do that. Much like Josh and Nathaniel, their stories don t end when they re not sleeping with Rebecca. So we had a bunch of stuff we wanted to do with Greg, and then Santino needed to move back to New York, so we accelerated all of that",

Back then, with Scott Disick trying to get a rise out of Kourtney by engaging in his World Sex Tour, the story was that Kourtney had decided to put an end to Scott s shenanigans by getting married to Younes for Keeping Up With The Kardashians  cameras.This time, the gossip comes from OK! s Australian edition, and alleges that Kourtney Kardashian s secret wedding to Younes came on an undisclosed Mexican beach. The magazine says that apparently,  with the world watching for the arrival of her sisters Kim, Khloe and Kylie Jenner s new babies, it s been the perfect time for low-key Kourt to sneak under the radar and say  I do  in secret. However, their story trips up by going on to claim   in the very next sentence   that Kris Jenner is  desperate to air  the supposedly secret ceremony on KUWTK. And just a bit later, the story then doubles down on its contradiction by further claiming that Kourtney Kardashian s secret wedding was atypical for the Kardashians in that it was only Kourtney and Younes and  a celebrant on the beach, with no cameras around. Further adding to the delightful deception is the magazine s cover, which does appear to depict a beach wedding ceremony, and which comes complete with privacy-ensuring canopies but which photo, as the good people at Gossip Cop point out, actually comes from Johnny Depp and Amber Heard s 2015 wedding.

    "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating since 2016, and most of the relationship was formed over a long distance. So now that they've made things official and are about to get married, it's fair to wonder if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are living together now or if royal protocol has kept them under different roofs. The answer is not all that surprising.When the couple first met, Suits was still filming in Toronto, which is where Meghan was posted up. To visit each other, the couple had to carry out an elaborate bait and switch plan to distract the paparazzi and keep their romance a secret, according to Us Weekly. Meghan would travel to London for events and they took vacations together, but it wasn't until late 2016 that the The Sun reported they were \"virtually inseparable\" and that Markle had \"practically moved in\" with Harry. By that time, the couple had made their relationship public.An anonymous source also told the outlet, \"They ve taken things to the next level. They re practically living together. She cooks for him, he pops out to the gym and they re just enjoying hanging out.\" For those who might be scandalized by the young couple living together before marriage, it's actually a lot more common than some might think -- even accounting for royal protocol.A source told HollywoodLife last year, \"The royal family has had to move with the times in order to survive, and they are nowhere near as stuffy and old fashioned as they used to be. Prince William and Kate Middleton lived together before marrying, so it s no shocker that Harry and Meghan plan to do the same.\"WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty ImagesRight now, they're living in Nottingham Cottage, a 1,300 square foot house on the Kensington Palace compound, according to People.",

The tabloid added that her \"excitement turned to horror when she learned they could be at risk for contracting\" the Zika virus which is dangerous for expectant moms.\"I'm told Meghan turned to Harry and announced, 'Of course, if the threat of Zika is still there in October, we will cancel the trip',\" the insider added.The Duke reportedly blew up and yelled at his wife telling Markle that they will not cancel the trip no matter what. \"You're a member of the royal family now   if we commit to something, we do it!\" Prince Harry said.According to Gossip Cop, however, the report is not reliable. The so-called insider constantly uses the words \"I'm told\" and \"I'm hearing\" which are telltale signs that the claims are illegitimate.

The magazine says the couple have been in therapy to fix their alleged marriage problems, but Gossip Cop looked into the report and we can exclusively set the record straight.Teigen opened up earlier this year about suffering postpartum depression after giving birth to daughter Luna last year, as well as her struggle with drinking too much. The model has since taken steps to work through both issues, but the latest issue of In Touch insists her marriage is falling apart over the situation. They are fighting nonstop,  a so-called  insider  tells the magazine.  They have been in marriage counseling for the last six months. They re trying very hard to make their marriage work. The outlet s questionable source further alleges there s  a terrible atmosphere  in Teigen and Legend s home because she s  been acting paranoid and jealous  and  they end up fighting about it all the time.  The supposed insider continues,  John has tried to be patient because he realizes this is a difficult time for Chrissy, but he is getting wiped out  It seems like they are trying to get through the day.  The dubious source concludes,  John and Chrissy s friends worry the marriage just won t survive. But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the couple about their alleged marital woes, and we re exclusively assured the tabloid s account of events is simply  not true.  We re told Legend and Teigen s relationship is going strong, and the claim otherwise is entirely inaccurate. Unfortunately, this isn t the first time we ve had to debunk a phony article about the happy spouses being at odds.Gossip Cop busted MediaTakeOut two years ago when it wrongly alleged Legend",

    "text": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Photo: Getty ImagesNearly two years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.Eventually, the acrimony between Pitt and Jolie seemed to die down a bit in the press   but only temporarily, as there have recently been a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this never-ending saga. Here, a look at what is happening with Brangelina s divorce.First, can we look back at their   uh   happier   days?Sure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004   back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.So what went wrong?Back in September 2016, we learned that an  incident  reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That  incident,  which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with",

As such, we re hearing that sources close to the royals are now alleging that Kate Middleton wants Prince William to go to couple s therapy with her.Couple s therapy works for some marriages, and doesn t work for others   but this is THE royal marriage we re talking about. Prince William s marriage to Kate Middleton is probably the most scrutinized marriage in the world, especially right now, and that attention will only make the idea of couple s therapy more difficult to pull off.For example, what therapist should they go to? What facility? Does the therapist come to the palace? Any way they try to slice this, the press getting even a whiff of this would lead to widespread speculation that Prince William and Kate Middleton are getting a divorce.Right now, the palace press office is in overdrive trying to fix Prince William s disastrous image, thanks to his Swiss rendezvous last week and clear disregard for protocol, tradition, or basic decency. His marriage to Kate Middleton is also clearly in tatters as a result, and any other wife might have left by know. However, Kate Middleton has worked most of her adult life to become a princess (they don t call her waity Katie for nothing), and it s going to take a lot more than this for her to throw that all away.Besides, Prince William has always been extraordinary stubborn about getting what he wants, and he never, ever seems to learn from his mistakes. While his family likely instilled some sense of guilt into him after last week, he s probably already reverted to behaving the way he always does   that is, with disregard to his reputation and his",

She said the pills left her immobile and drifting in and out of consciousness; he has said they were Benadryl. I was jolted awake and I felt Mr. Cosby s hand groping my breasts under my shirt,  she testified.  I also felt his hand inside my vagina moving in and out, and I felt him take my hand and place it on his penis and move it back and forth. But Mr. McMonagle insisted that Ms. Constand was lying, and that she and Mr. Cosby had a consensual sexual relationship, which she denied. They ve been intimate,  he said in his closing argument.

Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges   inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child   were dismissed. Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,  Nelson says.  To think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor s office finally did the right thing   they made an offer that he agreed to.   If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of. The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott s record.The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the  Goosebumps  rapper  encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.  He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.The news of Scott s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1.

Nearly a week after the big game, Brady finally addressed the loss on Instagram, Friday, sharing a photo of himself and teammate Rob Gronkowski along with a message of gratitude to everyone who supported him and his team. It has taken me a few days to reflect on our SB loss as well as the great season our team had,  Brady wrote.  There are many emotions when you come up short of your goal. And they are all part of learning and growing in this journey of life. He continued,  Learning turns everything into a positive. And the number one feeling I have had the past 4 days is gratitude. Gratitude to my teammates for the incredible effort given all season regardless of the challenges we faced.

In addition to criticizing the president on a regular basis, he s also done poignant monologues on healthcare and the Las Vegas shooting.  I would guess that he s not planning to visit me anytime soon,  the host said of Trump.  I think he and Sean Hannity have date night on those nights. It s tough to break away.  But he would  absolutely  love to have the president on his show.  I have a lot of questions for Donald Trump,  Kimmel said, adding,  Maybe this is crazy, but I feel like I can turn him around on a couple of things. Interviewer Amy Robach brought up Trump s son, Don Jr., with whom Kimmel had a Twitter feud last weekend after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.  He s an idiot. Let s just start with that,  he said of the First Son.  This is an imbecile whose job seems to be tweeting, as far as I can tell. But with that said, I do admire that he s very loyal to his father.  Kimmel went on to respond some backlash he received for seemingly not addressing the Weinstein controversy on TV soon enough. He said,  The Harvey Weinstein thing, people like this false equivalence. As if that somehow is equivalent to what happened in Las Vegas. Harvey Weinstein is not a person   is not a friend of mine. I m not in the movie business. And I ll add that that story came out, I think, like moments before we went to tape on Thursday and we didn t have a show on Friday.

    "text": "Serena Williams is officially back. She revealed on Instagram on Wednesday that she will return to professional tennis on Thursday, at Indian Wells, which coincides with International Women's Day.It would be a bit of an understatement to call Serena excited.A lot has changed for the tennis superstar in the past year. She gave birth to her daughter and endured scary ordeal in the hospital after having an emergency C-section that left her bed-ridden for six weeks. Her return coincides with a new Nike ad campaign, unveiled during Sunday night's Oscars broadcast, with Williams spreading the message that \"there's no wrong way to be a woman.\"On Thursday, Williams will get back to what thrust her into the public eye by returning to the tennis court against Zarina Diyas at Indian Wells in California, one of the larger non-Grand Slam tournaments. Williams hasn't played in a singles match since Jan. 28, 2017, when she won the Australian Open while approximately two months pregnant. After that, Williams took her leave. She gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Ohanian Jr., on Sep. 1 before suffering a serious scare post-pregnancy, in which Williams said she could have died without the quality health-care she had. After six weeks of bed rest, Williams started practicing again in December. She was hoping to be back in time for the 2018 Australian Open, but she ended up withdrawing.Williams has played professional matches, just not singles. Her official return was on Feb. 11 in a doubles match with Venus Williams in the Fed Cup. She was visibly rusty, and the sisters were swept 6-2, 6-3 against the Netherlands.According to Venus, however, Serena is just fine.\"She's got power, depth. She knows how to play,\" Venus said at the Tie Break Tens Tournament in Madison Square Garden, via ABC. \"Yeah, awesome game.\"Williams",

Tolkien. The streaming service has given a multi-season commitment to a LOTR series in the pact, which also includes a potential spinoff series.The LOTR original series, a prequel to Tolkien s The Fellowship of the Ring, will be produced by Amazon Studios in cooperation with the Tolkien Estate and Trust; HarperCollins; and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produced the hugely successful LOTR movie franchise.No details about the deal were disclosed, but it believed to be dwarfing any TV series pact to date with a whopping price tag attached.Amazon, Netflix and HBO had been approached by the Tolkien estate, who had been shopping the project. It came with an upfront rights payment said to be in the $200 million-$250 million range, and I hear Amazon landed the rights by paying close to $250 million. That is just for the rights, before any costs for development, talent and production, in proposition whose finances industry observers called  insane.  It is a payment that is made sight unseen as there is no concept, and there are no creative auspices attached to the possible series. On top of that, the budget for a fantasy series of that magnitude is likely to be $100 million-$150 million a season. The Lord of the Rings is a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of generations of fans through literature and the big screen,  said Sharon Tal Yguado, Head of Scripted Series at Amazon Studios.  We are honored to be working with the Tolkien Estate and Trust,",

The man had his arm around her but it didn t look romantic and was more like a side hug as they walked. According to the National Enquirer, Garner has been seeing a lawyer and it s so serious that she s introduced him to her family in West Virginia. She allegedly did this over the holidays, which means she s been with him for a while. There s no mention in the article if it s the same guy from the photos or if he s met her kids.Jennifer Garner  introduced her new lawyer beau to family members during a New Year s weekend in Montana   They stayed at a private residence in Yellowstone Club,  dished the source.  Jen and Ben arrived with the children. Ben celebrated Christmas with the kids but left to spend New Year s with Lindsay. Jen s boyfriend and her family arrived after Ben left   In October, Jen s sisters wanted to set her up on a blind date with a doctor, but she refused   Everyone thought it was because Jen wanted to stay single. But it s now looking more likely that she d already found someone new! [From The National Enquirer, print edition, March 26, 2018]It s possible that The Enquirer found the identity of the guy in the photos and that he s a lawyer but that Garner is just seeing him professionally. She must need legal services for her career and of course for her divorce. I hope this is true though. It s just a sidebar article, they re not honing in on US Weekly s misleading cover about Ben and Jen s non-reunion. How great would it be if Garner has an undercover civilian boyfriend and is just waiting for the right moment to premiere him? Would",

Lorde did, however, take the opportunity to elaborate on the initial quote she gave in her interview, where she seemed to say that she doesn t hang out much with the famous friends she s made in recent years and isn t  calling [her] idols  for advice.For one, Lorde noted that while some had thought she was referencing Swift as an  idol,  she was really just referring to David Bowie and Patti Smith, who she d mentioned earlier in the interview.She also expounded on the flaws of describing Swift s group of friends as a  squad.   I ve always found people s perception of this  squad  idea frustrating in the past,  she wrote.  It was never some exclusive club or secret society, but a wide circle of people, some of whom I know, and some who I ve never met, like most wide groups of friends. Forgive me for the mild eyeroll I popped when it was brought up as if we re all blood members of a secret cult.

This movie would not be the lasting Halloween tradition that it is without all of you,  Hoag, who played Reynolds  daughter, said to the crowd, Comicbook reports.  It was an honor to do these movies and it was a huge honor to work with the absolutely incredible, iconic, unbelievable, creative, talented Debbie Reynolds. When Brown first announced the family reunion, she teased that there would be a special tribute to the friendliest witch there ever was when the family came together, saying,  We wanted to do a special tribute to her and her role as Grandma Aggie and have a small monument set up there for her, so we re going to do that this year during the lighting ceremony.

Okay, actually, Beyonce and Jay-Z want to build this nursery. But let s be real   if Beyonce wants something, you think Jay-Z is going to say no?And also, when was the last time we saw Jay-Z claiming to want something, and Beyonce jumping on that bandwagon? And don t say a divorce #neverforgetthelevatorincident. Anyway, Radar s source claims,  Beyonce told Jay Z she wants a million-dollar nursery in her home! The place will have two of everything. It must have two lamps, changing tables, cribs, stuffed animals and a closet stocked with baby designer duds from Lanvin and Hermes . money is no object. It has to be perfect. Well, duh to that last part.  Money is no object , as though that even needed to be stated. Truthfully, the fact that this is news is somewhat mind boggling. Why does the fact that Beyonce wants a fancy, expensive nursery need to become a thing? In fact, it would have been more news-worthy had Beyonce NOT wanted a million dollar nursery? Have you SEEN Blue Ivy s clothes?!The more interesting part of this report is the fact that Beyonce  told  Jay-Z she wants a million dollar nursery, not that Jay-Z is  enthusiastic  about a million dollar nursery. Again, what Beyonce wants, Beyonce gets. But the phrasing of this report is definitely curious; it was alleged for a while that Jay-Z and Beyonce were still biding their time to announce a separation, or at least, a trial separation   and then bam, the announcement that came instead was that Beyonce was pregnant with twins. It s hard to believe that everything is suddenly hunky dory just because",

Many historic royals led explosive lives that revolved around death and controversy, and the palaces they called home bore witness to their dramatic intrigues. Perhaps as a result of these times, todays palaces are rich in ghost stories and sightings. Here are five royal residences that are said to be haunted:Buckingham PalaceWhere better to kick things off than the Queen s official workplace and London residence, Buckingham Palace. It is said that the rear terrace of Buckingham Palace is haunted by the ghost of an enchained monk in a brown cowl. He is believed to be the spirit of a monk who died in a punishment cell from a time when a monastery stood on the site. Another ghost that has been reported is that of Major John Gwynne, who served as King Edward VII's private secretary. After his divorce from his wife, the Major was shunned by upper society. Unable to cope with a life of shame, he ended his life in his first floor office, shooting himself in the head.Windsor CastleWindsor is perhaps the most haunted of all the royal residences, with as many as 25 ghosts reported. The ghost of Elizabeth I has been seen by several members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Margaret. Often seen in the library, her footsteps can be heard on the bare floorboards, before her striking presence appears. The ghost of George III has been witnessed, looking longingly out of the room beneath the library, where he was confined during his several periods of madness. Henry VIII is said to haunt the deanery cloisters, often heard hobbling around, the sound of his ulcerated leg thudding on the floor as he walks. On the",

It is hard and there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting,  the first daughter, 35, said on Fox News  Fox & Friends on Monday, June 12.  I was not expecting the intensity of this experience. But this isn t supposed to be easy. My father, and this administration, expects to be transformative. Ivanka continued,  I think some of the distraction and some of the ferocity I was a little blindsided by on a personal level. But for me, I m trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people. The businesswoman was asked how the president, 70, felt after watching former FBI Director James Comey s Senate testimony last week.  My father felt very vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic,  Ivanka said. (Trump abruptly fired Comey in May amid the FBI s investigation into whether Russia interfered with the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.) We are really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president,  the fashion designer added.During Monday s interview, Ivanka also shut down reports that her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was involved in palace intrigue.  There is a 24-hour news cycle that gets fed by and is encouraged by lots of salacious details,  Ivanka said.  At the end of the day, we are all focused on the work, and that s very true for Jared. He is somebody who just likes to get things done. So, he doesn t get involved in all",

    "text": "Sure, Shakira is famous for her hips that certainly don t lie, but she is also known for her iconic signature curly hair. And while the singer has oscillated between different tones of blonde throughout her career, she s stayed true to her natural texture. But now we have the secret to how she gets that enviably perfect curl pattern thanks to a handful of Instagram selfies shared on celebrity stylist Cynthia Alvarez s feed.Stars Without Makeup: See Stars Going Makeup-Free and Loving It!The She Wolf took a snapshot of her golden coils drying with colored hair clips strategically placed down the length to perfectly set their pattern as they dry. While it was an in-process shot, as Alvarez points out in her caption, the colorful clips also provide a reference to Solange s iconic imagery with pins in her locks from her song  Don t Touch My Hair. Another secret: once the curls have dried, Alvarez goes back in with a small curling iron and individually amps up the coils for that iconic Shakira bodacious head of spirals that she can toss around while she performs during her El Dorado World Tour. We know this because Shakira snapped a video of her stylist extraordinaire showing off a peak into their pre-show ritual.But with all of the curls and clips, sometimes things fall through the cracks. In a LOL-worthy moment the singer posted a short video clip backstage mid-performance in which the glam duo is laughing because they ve realized Shakira had an errant setting clip in her hair for the whole performance up to that point. Hey, at least the singer has a sense of humor about it.Stars Without Makeup: See Stars Going Makeup-Free and Loving It!The takeaway: if set your curls like Shakira, just don t forget to remove all the clips when you re done!Sign up",

Television found no misconduct occurred on the set of the reality series. As we previously stated, we recently became aware of allegations regarding an incident on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico,\" Warner Bros. said Tuesday in a statement. \"We take all such allegations seriously. The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew is our number one concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly. Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants. The news comes a little more than a week after Warner Bros. suspended production to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct on the Mexico set of the series. It's unclear whether the suspension will delay the launch of season four, which was originally slated to debut on Aug. 8.

We met on June 9 and it s her birthday. The network brought us together, so why not bring us even closer together?\"Shortly before the episode aired, however, franchise spoiler blogger Reality Steve published a report accusing Jenna of cheating on Jordan.

    "text": "  Daily Mirror-Daily MirrorBattling dodgy, dry and lacklustre skin? Change of season and weather can often result in a change of how your skin behaves. If you have sensitive skin, it can become more unbalanced leaving it blotchy and prone to blemishes. This is a great time to listen to the changing needs of your skin and update your skincare regime.There s no better way to rid your face of dead skin than to exfoliate it well. Carrying out an extra deep treatment to spring clean your face will instantly improve texture and reveal a brighter, fresher complexion. Here s how: Apply a creamy exfoliant generously to dry skin after cleansing and leave to dry for five minutes. Support the side of your face with one hand to stop skin from pulling and with long sweeping movements across your face, use your other hand to  flake away  the cream. (It s a good idea to put your face over the bathroom sink as the product will flake away, removing the build-up of old, dull cells with it). Remove excess by rinsing with warm water. Follow up with a serum or certified organic facial oil and moisturiser.Use a concentrated treatment product in your beauty regime to revitalise skin and boost radiance. Think of it as a shot of vitamins, antioxidants and nourishment all in one. It will help smooth fine lines and wrinkles and give your complexion a massive boost. Use it twice daily for four weeks and you ll notice the transformation of your skin.Multi-tasking beauty products have to be the best spring beauty hack of them all. A multi-purpose balm is great for keeping lips moisturised and healthy. You can use a liberal amount on nails and cuticles for a subtle shine and buffed look and it does a brilliant job of grooming",

It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put",

Nassar also is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges and has been sued by more than 125 women alleging abuse.Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation.Maroney, now 21, says the abuse began while she attended a U.S. National team training camp at the Karoyli Ranch in the Sam Houston Forest north of Houston. Maroney was 13 at the time and wrote Nassar told her she was receiving \"medically necessary treatment he had been performing on patients for over 30 years.\" Maroney did not detail Nassar's specific actions.Maroney, who won a team gold and an individual silver on vault as part of the \"Fierce Five\" U.S. women's team at the 2012 Olympics in London, said Nassar continued to give her \"treatment\" throughout her career. She described Nassar giving her a sleeping pill while the team traveled to Japan for the 2011 world championships. Maroney says Nassar later visited her in her hotel room after the team arrived",

Trooping the Colour is an annual thing for the Queen s birthday, and for this year s festivities, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge brought out Prince George and Princess Charlotte for their first balcony waves. It was actually pretty charming because kids are kids and kids don t really give a crap about royal protocol. George and Charlotte were probably better behaved than most kids would have been, but George was still pretty grumpy. So at one point, William knelt down to George s level. Will talked to George, possibly pointing out some of the planes or whatever, just trying to get George to brighten up. And the Queen was not amused.Come for the queen scolding William, stay for the George facepalm. pic.twitter.com/etvmofiU5m   Brandon McGinley (@brandonmcg) June 15, 2016While I love George s face-palm (the kid has no poker face), what I love most of all is that the Queen is basically the only person William will obey. If Charles had said,  Stand up, William,  would Will have done it? Nope. The Queen had to remind William that he wasn t there to make the moment better for his son, William was there to stand up straight and represent the monarchy. Kneeling is for peasants!!! A prince never crouches.Bonus photos of the Queen and her fabulous brooches at the Royal Ascot. I wish she would order Kate to stand up straight too!

But, first let's get to that buzzy clip.On Sunday August 27, Taylor dropped the full-length version at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, and it's a glittering, self-aware visual that tears down everything fans think they know about Taylor Swift while poking fun at every, single thing you've ever poked fun of her about, from always being surprised at award shows, to public perception that she's always playing the victim. Taylor acknowledges   and makes fun of herself for   every one of those things during the eye-popping video by bringing back to life all of her personas. Of course, this includes Taylor from the 2009 VMAs AKA the night that Kanye West bum rushed the stage.

Cannibal Club s visiting chefs  hail from around the world  and come to L.A. to  practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,  according to the Cannibal Club website.

Describing each dish as a  study in taste and elegance , Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains:  The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy.

    "text": "Here's what to know about neurological disorders in dogs and how pet owners can handle them.Neurological disorders in dogs can be scary, as they come on suddenly, leaving you feeling helpless. It's important for you to recognize the signs of canine neurological disorders to properly care for your pooch and get back to pet business as usual.Nancy Boman from Seattle, Washington, knew something was wrong when her three-year-old Saint Bernard, Tommy, had a seizure. She took him to the veterinarian, who ordered blood work, a brain MRI and a lumber puncture. Tommy was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy, a neurological disorder, with no identified cause.What Is a Canine Neurological Disorder?Neurological disorders in dogs are illnesses that stem from your pet's central nervous system, as well as the peripheral nervous system. According to Dr. Dwight Alleyne, a veterinarian at Acres Mill Animal Hospital in Canton, Georgia, the three main areas affected by canine neurological disorders are the brain, spinal cord and nerves. With brain disorders, he says, symptoms can include seizures, head tilt, tremors or blindness. With the spinal cord, he has a different list of symptoms.\"They include unsteady gait or compete paralysis with the front or hind limbs, problems with urination and loss of sense of pain in the affected limbs,\" he says. With nerves affecting the face, you may notice that your dog's face is paralyzed, that he can't blink properly, or that he might have lost some of his tongue function, explains Dr. Alleyne.What Are Some Other Types?Vestibular SyndromeAccording to Dr. Jon Klingborg, a veterinarian at Valley Animal Hospital in Merced, California, this disease typically occurs in older dogs. It happens suddenly when the balance center in dogs \"goes haywire\" and the dog wakes up feeling like the room is spinning. \"Most owners think their dog had a stroke,",

Ouch!When Hollywood s biggest stars hit the red carpet at the Oscar pre-parties on Feb. 27, we couldn t help but notice that a couple famous faces were noticeably missing from the A-list lineup: of course, we re talking about the Kardashian/Jenner clan! The Internet-breaking family was a no-show at the Raleigh Studios annual pre-party, and as it turns out, it had nothing to do with their busy schedules. In fact, a shocking new report claims that the women were actually BANNED from the VIP festivities after raising eyebrows with their  drunk  behavior in years past! Well, this certainly doesn t look good for the brand!Despite being some of the biggest names in Hollywood, the Kardashians were reportedly not welcome at the annual  Night Before  party at Raleigh Studios after displaying what some claimed was some pretty unacceptable behavior, according to a new Star magazine report. The reality TV stars were allegedly all denied an invite to the star-studded event   Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stalone, Kerry Washington and Alicia Vikander were among those who did make the cut, in case you were wondering   after a source tells the outlet Kris Jenner rubbed some people the wrong way with her sloppy behavior at a previous party.

He can tend to be very grumpy, and less cheerful than the other elves, but he acts how he does to keep the other elves working. Being the head-elf (or Arch-elf), he has the responsibility of looking after the workshop and the other elves.AppearancesBernard is first seen watching and smiling as Scott Calvin and his son, Charlie, arrive at the North Pole. Introducing himself as the head elf, Bernard explains that Scott has assumed the duties of Santa Claus by putting on Santa's suit, which he proves by showing a clause written on the former Santa's business card. Though Scott immediately denies this, Bernard explains that Scott will have until Thanksgiving to get his affairs in order before returning to become Santa full-time. Bernard also bonds with Charlie, giving him a snow globe (while also calling him \"sport\" as Scott does). Charlie thanks Bernard for the snow globe and promises to take good care of it, and Bernard replies with \"Make sure you do\".During the year, Scott begins transforming into Santa. At some point, Bernard sends Santa's list to Scott's home address.Around Thanksgiving, Bernard arrives at the home of Charlie's mother and stepfather, Laura and Neil Miller, where Scott is trying to visit Charlie despite the previous suspension of Scott's visitation rights. By this point, Scott has been inspired by Charlie to become Santa, and Bernard takes them both to the North Pole. Bernard and the other elves help with the preparations for Christmas.

Positive reviews for the movie recognize its 'good, raunchy fun,' noting that it might possible cause you to \"crack up from start to finish, while also leaving you misty-eyed and wanting to hug your mom.\"But, as always, with the good comes the bad. As it stands now, the film has a score of 40% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics taking aim at the film's lackluster plot and half decent humor.'Snatched' hits theaters on May 12.Here are 7 of the worst reviews.Slant Magazine critic Keith Watson:\"It's not surprising that even in a film set in Latin America it's the white actors who're front and center, but it's dismaying how comfortable the filmmakers are in treating the film's few Ecaudorian and Colombian characters as mere props for violent gags. Dippold and Levine are smart enough to winkingly call attention to some of their own racial stereotyping, but they're never quite clever enough to turn a critical eye on their protagonists or to interrogate the cultural assumptions embedded in their own white-women-in-peril narrative.\"News.com AU critic Wenlei Ma:\"There are some great laugh-out loud moments ( Welcome/whale cum ) and the supporting characters have a lot of fun (Barinholtz and Wanda Sykes are highlights) but there are a lot more misses than there are hits. Snatched is narratively incoherent and often really boring. It s more like an extended sketch show where only every second or third joke works.\"Time Out critic Tom Huddleston:\"...Schumer needed to show her range  ",

Hailey loves kids too, and they both share the same morals and family values, it s one of the many things Justin loves so much about Hailey,  the source continued.  They ve spoken about starting a family and it s definitely something they want to do as soon as they are married. Because of their shared faith, neither Justin or Hailey would want her to get pregnant before they were married. That s very important to them both. They really want to do things how they perceive to be the right way.

The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn t want to hear it. I didn t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am.

Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.Bach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach s payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn t sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.Hasselhoff s European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he s reportedly unsure if his new reality show,  Hoff the Record,  will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.While the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff s assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.Though Bach s team alleges that Hasselhoff s net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat. I am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach s] support,  Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.Though he is set to make an appearance in next year s  Baywatch  reboot, it s unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress.

As the photographer's camera snapped, Kim, sporting the gold medal she won in Pyeongchang, and Fallon crept in to make goofy poses in the background   including one with Fallon in a blond wig and a knockoff gold medal.Only after the pics were taken did the mischievous duo reveal themselves to the squealing delight of their victims. They then took proper photos with their fans.Kim seemed as calm on national television as she did on the halfpipe. The California native, after all, is someone who went for   and landed   difficult back-to-back 1080s on her final run, despite having already secured the win.

The claim comes from the HollywoodLife, a site that has previously published fake news stories alleging they're already engaged, were getting engaged on Christmas, had a \"secret wedding,\" were eloping, and may \"never get married\" at all. The blog has also falsely reported a couple of times that Shelton and Stefani have split up.@gwenstefani / InstagramBasically, the outlet throws everything against the wall, hoping something will stick. And wedged inside its Jenga-like tower of lies, the site contends it's learned its supposed information from sources \"close\" to the couple. But based on how frequently off-base the blog is, it's clear many of these articles are just fabrications.On the heels of Shelton, Stefani and her kids looking like a happy family at the Super Bowl, the aptly nicknamed HollywoodLies maintains Shelton is taking their \"relationship to the next step.\" The often discredited site asserts a \"source close\" to Shelton leaked that his \"team\" has gone to \"shop for jewelry\" for him. A so-called \"insider\" is quoted as saying, \"One of Blake's assistants was spotted visiting and shopping with a private jeweler in Beverly Hills this week.\" The questionable source adds that the diamond ring would be for a \"Valentine's Day proposal.\"Naturally, the habitually wrong outlet doesn't mention when Shelton's \"assistant\" supposedly went engagement ring shopping. And suspiciously, the blog doesn't seem to have the name of the (probably nonexistent) jeweler. It also bears noting that HollywoodLies would like its readers believe that for such an important and meaningful present, like an engagement ring, Shelton simply sent out an \"assistant\" and told him or her to pick out something nice for Stefani.Irrespective of how the article is missing key information",

In fact, Kourtney was too busy having her own party in Mexico with all of her closest friends to celebrate her 38th birthday   without Scott!Despite the fact that both Tyga and Scott are single now, one of their rumored flings just so happened to be at the TAG Heuer party, too. It was Ella Ross, the stylist/model who Scott is rumored to be seeing now that he s done with Kourtney. Although Scott and Ella weren t pictured together during the party, photos on the Daily Mail show her leaving with a friend in the backseat of a super fancy luxury vehicle. Possibly set up by Scott?

How should we look at two giant hurricanes coming back-to-back like this?  the 46-year-old said in the clip recorded at the airport in Orlando, Florida.  Do we write them off as coincidence? Do we write it off as a statistical anomaly? Wow! Who would ve thought? Is it just Mother Nature in a bad mood? I don t know how you think about it but I think it could be something much more than all of that. He then quoted a section from the Bible and said that hurricanes are  a spectacular display of God s immense power. When he puts his power on display, it s never without reason,  he continued.  There s a purpose. And we may not always understand what that purpose is, but we know it s not random and we know that weather is sent to cause us to respond to God in humility, awe and repentance. The video has been shared more than 5,000 times and has attracted more than 3,000 comments, some agreeing with his opinion, others dissenting strongly. Amazing. He actually thinks a god murders people with weather events, in order to teach them humility. Kirk has an impressively twisted mind,  one wrote. Tape your mouth shut idiot,  another commented. God doesn t cause hurricanes Dave,  another wrote.  Heat, wind and water do. So let me get this straight, your magical sky wizard sent the hurricanes that HAVE ALREADY KILLED PEOPLE as a display of his love? #notmygod,  another commenter wrote.The death toll from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and dumped several feet of rain on southeast Texas, has risen to at least 70.Irma has swept through",

    "text": "Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage   and seven years as a couple. In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,  says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane.  This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.Pharrell and Jennifer Aniston at Ellen DeGeneres' birthday.The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin  in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.On Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres  birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.The next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor.

The newlyweds reportedly have plans to honeymoon in Tetiaroa, an atoll in French Polynesia. Middleton and Matthews will reportedly be enjoying their first few days as husband and wife at The Brando , a high-end, eco-friendly resort that welcomed former President Barack Obama and wife Michelle for a post-presidency getaway in April.Legendary actor Marlon Brando purchased the island in the 1960s after falling in love with it during the filming of his 1962 flick Mutiny on the Bounty ; he also met his third wife, Tarita, on the set of the film. The Brando was a shared vision between the Godfather actor and businessman Richard Bailey, and the pair began conceptualizing the project in 1999. However, Brando passed away in 2004, and the resort didn't open its doors till a decade later, in late 2014. Since then, it has acted as an exotic escape for some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Barbra Streisand. The island resort is environmentally conscious, making use of seawater air-conditioning, solar electricity, and generators running on coconut oil.The LIFE Picture Collection/GettThe resort features 30 one-bedroom villas for about $3,370 a night; four two-bedroom villas for approximately $6,740 per night; and one 2,648-square-foot, three-bedroom villa for about $10,117 a night. As one would imagine, the latter is the preferred property for celebrities and honeymooners, though newlyweds who prefer a cozier accommodation opt for a one-bedroom villa.Each one-bedroom villa includes a cozy sitting room, a media room, and a walk-through dressing area that opens onto an adjoining bedroom with a king-size bed.

His hand fell between Burgess  thighs before she quickly and discreetly relocated it.Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Bolton swore the  hand placement that went south, so to speak  was  totally unintentional. I was just stargazed by Nick and Peta s performance and I was looking at the TV screen,  Bolton explained.  I felt her bump into me yet I wasn t really looking at what was bumping into me.

I was telling her before we started tonight,  I can t look at you for too long. I might get distracted. That s why I might miss some of my steps,    Bolton said.  She s obviously beautiful. Burgess explained that the competition was her focus. Oh gosh,  the 31-year-old dancer told reporters.  I am a professional. Look, we have a lot of chemistry and we have a lot of fun, but first and foremost we are trying to do a really great job in this competition.

    "text": "Caitlyn Jenner is secretly planning a wedding with her much younger, rumored girlfriend, Sophia Hutchins, according to a shocking new report! Here s the scoop.Despite a 47-year age difference, Caitlyn Jenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been spending quite a bit of time together lately, and now, there are rumors that they may even be getting married!  They consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,  an insider tells RadarOnline. The site also reports that Caitlyn and Sophia are making  secret plans to tie the knot  and that Caitlyn is actually in a rush to get married again after her fallout with the Kardashian sisters. Cait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,  Radar s source claims. This is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians had left her feeling isolated. Sophia has changed all that.  The ladies are reportedly planning their nuptials for this summer in Malibu. However, an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that reports of an engagement and upcoming wedding for Caitlyn and Sophia are  not true. It s no secret that Caitlyn and Sophia have a very close relationship, though. Romance rumors first began in 2017, when the women were seen together in Mexico. Recently, they ve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they ve never confirmed any reports of a romance.Like Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn s home on Sophia s Instagram page. The women recently attended the Erasing the Stigma Leadership Awards together on April 26, as well as the GLAAD",

The proof of a relationship has been growing ever since.It is now being reported that Caitlyn is ready to tie the knot with the blonde beauty. \"They consider each other soulmates and freely admit they couldn't imagine a life with anyone else at this point,\" a source told Radar. However, don't expect the Kardashians, especially her daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, to be in attendance. \"They've heard from friends that Caitlyn's dating Sophia, and it upsets them like you wouldn't believe,\" another source told Life & Style. \"She's their age! They feel a mix of jealousy and distrust about it.\"(Photo Credit: Getty Images)In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life   which was released last year  the transgender rights advocate opened up about her future dating prospects after announcing her transition in 2015. \"A future female companion?

There s a life s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne.

According to the National Enquirer, Tatum asked his  stunning wife  to join him  for a dip in their steamy jacuzzi,  but when Jenna  slipped beneath the boiling bubbles,  she found the actor  attached to a massive fish tail!  In terribly unnatural language, the outlet s seemingly fake  source  is quoted as saying,  As Jenna s jaw jerked wide open, Hubby cracked up as he explained he d just signed up for a new version of the mermaid Daryl Hannah/Tom Hanks Splash movie, only this time he s a merman!  The magazine s dubious  insider  goes on to purport,  Channing couldn t resist showing Wifey his mixed appendage, which made quite a sex splash at home, especially after the tail had come off! But if it wasn t already obvious, the Enquirer s latest report is entirely fictional. While it s true Channing is set to star in the upcoming remake of Splash, a source close to the Magic Mike actor tells Gossip Cop that the story about him surprising his wife in their jacuzzi wearing a merman costume is simply  made-up.  Additionally, the publication fails to provide any specifics about where he got the alleged merman tail, and if the supermarket tabloid had reputable insiders, they certainly wouldn t refer to either star as  hubby  or  wifey.  The report is nothing more than a fabrication.Bizarrely, this isn t the first time Gossip Cop has corrected the often disproven magazine for publishing an inaccurate article about the remake of the 1980 s fantasy-comedy.

    "text": "Before it was released in May 1977, not everyone was convinced George Lucas  space opera about a wizard, a farm boy and a princess would even be a hit, much less that 40 years later Star Wars would still be one of the biggest names in pop culture.Following humble and scrappy beginnings, the Star Wars films have grossed over $7.5 billion, and with $42-plus billion in total revenue to date, it s the second most lucrative entertainment brand ever (behind Pok mon, believe it or not).Though the best of the films are undisputed classics, there have been ups and downs (pretty much unavoidable after four decades). Here we ve ranked them all, including the much-hyped Solo: A Star Wars Story, now playing in theaters.Note: this list only covers theatrically released films in the franchise, so there will be no mention of the 1980s Ewok television movies or the 1978 holiday special (which is probably for the best). There will be some spoilers for previous movies, but we ll avoid details when discussing Solo: A Star Wars Story, so as long as you re caught up on earlier entries, read on!In ascending order, here is our ranking of all 11 theatrical Star Wars movies, including Solo: A Star Wars Story:(Lucasfilm Animation/ Warner Bros.)11. Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly with the first line of his 2008 review:  Has it come to this? Set between the events of Episode II and Episode III, this 98-minute 3D animated novelty served as a big-screen lead-in to the premiere of the TV show of the same name two months later. The popularity and longevity of this decades-old series has a lot to do with how much it appeals to audiences of all ages, bringing families and generations together in passionate fandom. The Clone Wars works best",

Jennifer Lopez, who stars as NYPD detective Harlee Santos on the NBC crime drama Shades of Blue, hired a private investigator to tail her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. He found out and they had a huge fight,  the insider tells Us.  But they re working through it. Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez s Ridiculously Chic Couple StyleIn June, the former New York Yankees third baseman, 41, was plagued by cheating rumors after the National Enquirer published an interview with his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter.Worried that her four-month romance with Rodriguez was too good to be true, the  Ain t Your Mama  singer, 47, resorted to subterfuge.  She s really into Alex and wants it to work,  the source adds.  So she s trying to control as much as she can. Despite the brief setback, the couple have had no problem gushing over each other in recent interviews. Earlier this month, J.

He s a generous human being with his family, with his friends, with me,  Lopez told the outlet.  He s caring and sweet and capable and responsible and just all the beautiful things you would want a man to be. I feel really lucky right now, so I m excited about life, but I m more excited for people to get to see who he really is. And the feeling is mutual.

What could possibly go wrong?Well, apparently everything.Miserable festival-goers, some of whom shelled out as much as $250,000 for premium tickets, tweeted images of shoddy sleeping tents, paltry security and boxed meals that won't earn any Michelin stars. It appeared there were no bikini-clad models cavorting on the sand.Blink-182 seemed to sense impending disaster. The band bailed on Fyre almost a full day before its Friday kickoff.G.O.O.D. Music, Lil Yachty, Major Lazer and Migos had also been slated to perform at the glitzy two-weekend festival, which had been hyped on social media by Kendall Jenner and other celebrities.As of Friday afternoon, several attendees claimed they were stranded on the Exuma Cays   scenes that sounded like Coachella meets \"Lord of the Flies.\" (The island was \"once owned\" by Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, organizers have said.)\"It's every man for himself,\" Tom Knight, 21, told NBC News on Friday. \"As of right now, we have no plans   like, we don't know if they are keeping us here, if we're flying back today. There is nothing set up.\"\"There's just chaos right now,\" said Knight, who said he paid $1,600 to attend. \"Everybody is standing around.

The hilarity of the show doesn t rely on the host but it rests on the host s ability to play along. A lot of it is with the set, a lot of it is with the audience   every year, they keep doing better and better,  Cena explained. The show is a vehicle to do so many moments at once.

In November 2016,  super mom  Sherri Papini was abducted while jogging in Redding, California. Then 22 days later, the petite blonde was discovered bruised, shackled and partially clothed on the side of a road 150 miles from her home.Papini, who was 34 at the time, claimed she was kidnapped by two Hispanic women. But now, nearly a year later, investigators continue to poke holes in her story.On Wednesday, October 25, the Shasta County Sheriff s Office released sketches of her suspected abductors as well as new details on Papini s mysterious disappearance.Stars at CourtSgt. Brian Jackson told The Sacramento Bee on Wednesday that detectives found a woman s DNA on Papini s body but a man s DNA on her clothing, despite her claims that she was kidnapped by two females. The DNA samples submitted to the criminal database do not belong to Sherri or her husband, Keith Papini.Authorities also released information about a fight Sherri allegedly got into with of one the suspects in which she claimed to have cut her foot, even though investigators have no evidence of a cut, local newspaper The Record Searchlight reported Wednesday.Per the Record Searchlight, Sherri had been texting with a male acquaintance from Michigan prior to her disappearance and they had planned to meet up when he was in California. Police questioned the individual and concluded that he was not involved in the incident.The initial 911 call made by Keith on November 2, 2016, was also released on Wednesday.  I m, like, totally freaking out thinking, like, somebody grabbed her,  he said.

    "text": "The curse of Michael Strahan continues to haunt Kelly Ripa.Multiple sources revealed on  Page Six TV  Wednesday that Ripa, 47, demanded her  Live!  co-host Ryan Seacrest cancel an appearance on ABC s  Good Morning America  at the very last minute. Ryan was scheduled to be on Wednesday s show well in advance. He s been on the show rundown for a week. Then yesterday, or maybe even as late as last night, Kelly threw a s t fit and told him he couldn t do  GMA,  so he pulled his appearance,  a source told us.Seacrest, 42, was supposed to appear on the show to promote ABC s new  American Idol  season with judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan.Seacrest immediately pulled the plug in order to not upset Ripa   who famously had a meltdown, stormed off and took a week off when Strahan, 45, quit her show without giving her advance warning in 2016   another source added. It s very clear that Ryan wants to stay on her good side. She s an executive producer on the show, so she has a lot of pull. It s fair to say she has a lot of influence over him. He joined her show. It sounds like she still feels threatened,  the source said. There s still bad blood with Kelly and Strahan, and she doesn t want history to repeat itself and Ryan to be lured to  GMA  too,  the first source said.But ABC brass didn t bat an eye over Ripa s tantrum given that they re indebted to her after the way they handled the Strahan situation when he fled to  GMA. Kelly isn t going to be reprimanded for this, as diva-like as it is, because it s not worth upsetting her for a three-minute hit with Ryan on  GMA.

As the chairman and C.E.O. of CBS Corporation, he oversees shows ranging from  60 Minutes  to  The Big Bang Theory.  His portfolio includes the premium cable channel Showtime, the publishing house Simon & Schuster, and a streaming service, CBS All Access. Moonves, who is sixty-eight, has a reputation for canny hiring and project selection. The Wall Street Journal recently called him a  TV programming wizard ; the Hollywood Reporter dubbed him a  Wall Street Hero.  In the tumultuous field of network television, he has enjoyed rare longevity as a leader. Last year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he earned nearly seventy million dollars, making him one of the highest-paid corporate executives in the world. In recent months, Moonves has become a prominent voice in Hollywood s #MeToo movement. In December, he helped found the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, which is chaired by Anita Hill.  It s a watershed moment,  Moonves said at a conference in November.  I think it s important that a company s culture will not allow for this. And that s the thing that s far-reaching. There s a lot we re learning. There s a lot we didn t know.  But Moonves s private actions belie his public statements. Six women who had professional dealings with him told me that, between the nineteen-eighties and the late aughts, Moonves sexually harassed them. Four described forcible touching or kissing during business meetings, in what they said appeared to be a practiced routine. Two told me that Moonves physically intimidated them or threatened to derail their careers. All said that he became cold or hostile after they rejected his advances, and that they believed their careers suffered as a result.  What happened",

    "text": "For all the rumors out there that Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes are breaking up, there is alternative information put out by . . . someone who suggests otherwise. A seemingly very well-connected source at Page Six is passing on info that the couple is still in regular communication.Apparently a  jet-setting source  told Page Six that Holmes and Foxx were FaceTiming on the plane as Holmes and Suri Cruise departed for Paris:  She said she loves him and asked if he wanted  cookies from Paris.  He was in Miami.  Suri s nanny was reportedly also on the plane.Foxx has, indeed, been in Miami; he was seen at mega-club E11EVEN on Sunday. The fact that we know this, and that we know Holmes is in Paris with Suri for fashion shows, is kind of monumental. This is a pairing that has managed to stay below the surface since they got together in 2013; though there is a timeline of their relationship, there are big gaps here where no one knows anything.As Vanity Fair pointed out last year, Holmes and Foxx went to F.B.I.-level lengths to avoid tabloid attention. They reportedly hid out in a luxury resort to celebrate at least Holmes s 38th birthday, and Holmes  put on a wig and hat  to meet Foxx.Now, it seems that the high-security walls of this relationship keep tumbling down. People are overhearing FaceTime conversations and spotting Foxx and Holmes out during their nighttime adventures. Perhaps we had fair warning: last year, Us Weekly reported that Holmes was tired of  playing the hiding game.  And what better way to combat breakup rumors than to stop hiding altogether?",

The series, which saw the network stunningly reverse its cancellation after its freshman run, had been in negotiations between Sony TV and NBC.While not a ratings breakout, Timeless averages a 1.2 in the key adults 18-49 demo and nearly 5 million total viewers with seven days of delayed viewing; the May 13 season two finale ticked up slightly (though it did not best its season average).

Diaz, though, is probably totally fine with the decision. She and husband Benji Madden are utterly in love, and she has enough money from past films to live very comfortably for the rest of her life. Speaking of which, what is Cameron Diaz s net worth, anyway?The actress has starred in so many amazing films that it s hard to keep track of them all, and her name is basically iconic at this point. So is it that shocking that she would consider retiring from Hollywood? According to her friend and one-time co-star Selma Blair, not really. In an interview from this weekend featured in Metro.com, Blair talked about the possibility of a sequel to The Sweetest Thing, saying,\"I would have liked to do a sequel but Cameron's retired from acting, she's like, 'I'm done.' I mean, she doesn't need any more films. She has a pretty great life. I don't know what it would take to bring her back.\"She does seem to have a pretty great life, and while money isn t everything, it probably doesn t hurt. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Cameron Diaz s net worth is $140 million. Whew.That number hasn t been confirmed by Diaz, but it certainly seems as though it could be accurate. Diaz has been in the spotlight for over two decades. She started modeling at age sixteen, and got her first acting role in The Mask in 1994, a movie that grossed $343.9 million in the worldwide box office. She also appeared in mega-hits like My Best Friend s Wedding, which grossed $299 million worldwide, and There s Something About Mary, which grossed $369 million",

Khloe, however, makes it clear that she has Rob s back.  It just sucks,  the Good American designer says.  He s made out to [be] this bad guy when [Chyna] is taunting him.

As previously reported, the former couple s custody battle over 14-month-old daughter Dream got ugly when Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob in July 2017 after he went on an explicit Instagram rant in which he posted nude photos of her. They settled their custody agreement two months later. Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,  Chyna s attorney Lisa Bloom told Us Weekly in a statement at the time, noting that the Arthur George sock designer does not have  more than 50 percent custody. While Chyna and Rob may have settled their custody drama, the exes are still tied up in legal drama over their canceled reality series, Rob & Chyna.

When I met Jess, it was undeniable how beautiful she is. We were at a surprise party in Hollywood at a speakeasy kind of a bar, a private club, and we were standing around in a group of people,  he reveals in the book.  I made some sort of sarcastic comment, really dry. Nobody got it except her. She laughed, and I noticed, all of a sudden, and in the way where you wonder if a person s like you, if they have a very dry, dark sense of humor too. Despite all of that, Timberlake didn t initially ask for her number because  it wasn t the right time. I had to psych myself up,  Timberlake writes of preparing to ask her out.  I had to remind myself that I was me -- giving myself a pep talk, shadowboxing with myself, rubbing my own shoulders. Timberlake, as it turns out, didn t even make the next move! A mutual friend offered to bring Biel, 36, along to one of his shows, something that Timberlake graciously accepted. Patience may not be my strong suit but, apparently, playing coy is,  he quips of the not-so-chance meeting.From there, Biel and her group of friends rode with Timberlake on a bus to his next show, during which time they  talked the whole way up  and were  joking around.

Now, we have the real scoop and you ve got to hear this!Did Demi Lovato s overdose really make Wilmer Valderrama, 38, realize that he wants to marry her?   The answer is NO, despite a report which has claimed otherwise.  Marriage with Demi at one point in Wilmer s life was something that was talked about while they were dating,  a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  There were many occasions where he almost popped the question.  However, that was then and this is now.  Wilmer has been broken up with Demi for a while, and even though she is going through a tough time, it s not giving him thoughts on getting back together with her or to marry her,  the insider says.There is absolutely no bad blood, the source reveals, noting that Wilmer paid Demi multiple visits in the hospital during her recovery. Ultimately, he just wants the best for his ex, especially in terms of her health.  Wilmer wants Demi to be healthy,  the insider says, explaining,  He wants his friend to live a successful and healthy life.     A relationship further than that is not something Wilmer is interested in pursuing right now. Its just not the time to think about anything like that. The matter of Demi getting better and on the right path is everything that is on Wilmer s mind. Not romance. Demi was allegedly found unconscious after a drug overdose inside her Hollywood Hills home after a night of heavy partying with friends on Tuesday, July 24. A friend inside her home called 911, pleading with the dispatcher that they needed to get help as soon as possible. Demi reportedly received Narcan, a lifesaving",

Not to hedge around, but we arrived at the impasse of hitting a brick wall. This was not a happy situation for us in terms of the logistics of a functioning band. To that purpose, we made a decision that we could not go on with him. Majority rules in term of what we need to do as a band and go forward. Fleetwood also called Buckingham s ousting business as usual, the outlet said.Buckingham did not respond to Rolling Stone s multiple requests for comment.Mick FleetwoodDia Dipasupil/Getty ImagesLindsey Buckingham, Stevie NicksKevin Winter/Getty ImagesBuckingham joined Fleetwood Mac with then-girlfriend and singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks in 1974. He left the group in 1987 and rejoined the band a decade later. Our relationship has always been volatile,  she told Rolling Stone about the musician.  We were never married, but we might as well have been. Some couples get divorced after 40 years. They break their kids  hearts and destroy everyone around them because it s just hard.

    "text": "Playboy founder Hugh Hefner only passed away weeks ago, but plans have already been made to turn the story of his life into the next big Hollywood biopic.It s been widely reported that Jared Leto will play the millionaire publisher, who passed away aged 91 from natural causes on September 27. The next step? Finding Leto a leading lady or several, since Hefner was married three times, and had plenty of girlfriends in between.One name that s been thrown in the mix is Margot Robbie, who Hefner himself would have approved of, since Robbie was one star he couldn t get to pose for his magazine. Back in 2014, after seeing Robbie s performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, Hefner told Us Weekly,  She should be in Playboy! Send her a message. We re ready for her. She would be great. He particularly enjoyed Robbie s nude scenes, adding,  I was very aware of that! The girl that plays [Jordan Belfort s] wife in [the movie] is very, very pretty. While Robbie declined Hefner s offer to pose in his magazine, The Mirror reports she s considering the upcoming film opportunity.  Margot turned down the offer before but this is different. She s considering,  said a source.Leto s casting could also be one of the factors that gets Robbie involved, since the two actors have worked together before (playing the Joker and Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad), and have great chemistry. Jared is working on the movie with his buddy Brett [Ratner] and they re really pushing for Margot to have a major role,  the source added.  She s perfect for a part and he s not going to give up until she accepts. ",

Apparently Amal s showing pregnancy signs, & it may even be twins again!A third child already? George, 56, and Amal Clooney s, 39, friends reportedly believe the star couple are expecting once again, according to Life & Style magazine. And although Amal gave birth to baby twins Ella and Alexander back in June, the two would reportedly be  thrilled  if they were to expand their family once again.  [Amal] has the same symptoms she had when she learned she was pregnant the first time,  an alleged close friend told the magazine.  She s eating like crazy and is more emotional than normal.  Click here to see pics of Amal s stunning maternity style.Her friends apparently believe the human rights lawyer is still in the very early stages of pregnancy, but even weeks from now, there may still be no sign of a bump.  During her first pregnancy, Amal barely showed for the first several months, and was active and working right up until a few weeks before the birth,  the source said.  But she was tired a lot and had trouble getting to a healthy baby weight.  At the same time however, if Amal truly is pregnant, her weight may not be an issue this time around.  Amal s been loving going out to dinner while the family has been in Italy over the summer,  the insider added.  She s craving pasta, risotto, and margherita pizza. At times it seems like she could be eating for three! And as it turns out, she actually COULD be!  Having twins once does increase your chance of having them again,  Dr. Pari Ghodsi, ob-gyn, shared with the publication.  Older moms are also more likely",

The Tomb Raider actress  attorney Bley DeJean later said to PEOPLE,  What has been filed by Brad s side today is a blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children.

    "text": "If you're someone who likes to read really scary ghost stories, it would be relatively easy to be hard on Tom Ogden's \"Haunted Hollywood: Tinseltown Terrors, Filmdom Phantoms and Movieland Mayhem.\" More than likely, most seasoned readers of phantom filled fare won't find this book especially frightening, but it is entertaining and does seem to be well researched overall.The narrative is actually quite absorbing once you get used to Ogden's somewhat methodical approach to documenting the numerous haunted locales covered in the book, but the way the author frames most of the supernatural details of each story, by first introducing some minor (and often not particularly interesting) character who inevitably leads us to the haunting in question, may actually scare some readers off straight away.Mr. Ogden actually tackles the even tougher task of trying to get the average reader to stick with him once he's launched into several paragraphs of background information and biographical details about the alleged ghostly manifestations of the famous people profiled in Haunted Hollywood. Naturally, since the vast majority of these dearly departed celebs passed away quite a number of years ago, it is more than understandable that the author would feel duty bound to expound on who they were and just how important they may have once been in Hollywood. However, all the extraneous information may leave the average reader feeling more than a little sidetracked. Or maybe led on a wild ghost chase, perhaps, given that something on the order of a good half of this book is almost purely biographical in nature. And most of that biographical stuff really isn't scary at all.

It s not easy to get adolescents excited about visiting a dusty old art museum, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art s blockbuster Michelangelo exhibition might just have found a way tailor-made to lure at least one special teen.

The museum tweeted about his visit early Thursday morning. Despite being a trained ninja, his entrance was anything but stealthy: Appearing in full costume, complete with signature orange mask, Mikey threw his arms up with joy as he entered the show, which has been hailed as  an art historical tour de force  by the New York Times.This morning we welcomed Michelangelo, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (@TMNT) at The Met.

That puts it on track to be one of the institution s top 10 most-visited shows ever before it closes on February 12.Though  Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer  wouldn t seem to need the extra push, the appearance of the hero is a clever ploy to draw in young fans via a little Turtle Power.The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles originated as a 1984 comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, centering on crime-fighting turtles who happen to be named after artists: Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and, of course, Michelangelo.

    "text": "On the show, though, June is so special that her scowl might as well be on the currency for the revolution. Her husband confronts her captor in Canada. She delivers her own baby. Even though people died to help her escape at the beginning of the season, she s determined now to stay in Gilead, because I guess Season 3 has to be about something. One read is that there s no escaping the suffocation of a subjugating regime. Except within the show, there actually is escaping it   and yet June has decided not to.Season 2 has been dutifully brutal, complete with ample torture, rapes, executions and murders. It gave in to every one of the show s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development or new interiority. Every inch of existence is awful. Cookies are inedible. Oprah is in exile. We re at the North Pole of misery and being told to walk north.So all the show can do is walk in circles. June s primal wound is being separated from her daughter Hannah. That can t be heightened on, so instead, Season 2 just repeats it. This, too, could seem eerily resonant, given the human rights crisis at the Mexican border that saw immigrant children being separated from their parents. But not entirely, because one essential flash point of present-day America  The Handmaid s Tale  ignores is race and ethnicity. Our United States definitely does not.June s trauma repeats, and so does everyone else s. June s pal Emily (Alexis Bledel), who last season was punished by having her clitoris cut off, was sent to the gulag, as was Janine (Madeline Brewer), who last season had her eye removed. After they toiled for a few episodes, it was back to Gilead for them both   back to desultory trips to",

Get push notifications with news, features and more.The singer, 38, wed the sound engineer in 2008 in an ultra-private ceremony that they kept hidden from the public until more than a year later. I went through an emotionally difficult time last summer and I actually wrote and sung myself songs to get through it,  Furtado, who s currently promoting her sixth studio album, The Ride, said about the breakup.  I would sing to myself while I drove on these long drives, and I thought to myself,  I m so lucky that I can write songs because I can soothe myself with them.' And though she s still working through her heartbreak, the star says she s focusing on her 13-year-old daughter, Nevis (with ex Jasper Gahunia). Sometimes you just want to sit home and bake some muffins for your daughter. I need to stay mentally and emotionally and physically well for my daughter,  she said.In 2014, Furtado opened up about collaborating with Castellon on both her 2006 album, Loose, and her Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, which went platinum and won a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal. It s a healthy tension working together,  she told PEOPLE.  It doesn t always go smoothly, of course, and it can be really challenging when there are differences of opinion, which of course happens. We re very blessed to have a beautiful family. We have a great life together. Life is good,  she added.",

    "text": "Playboy's frisky, playful bow-tied bunny logo is a cultural icon that is instantly recognizable. It evokes images of the decadent, pleasure-seeking lifestyle shown in Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. The success of the magazine led Hefner to open a chain of nightclubs, the Playboy Clubs. Early members received a distinctive key with the bunny logo on its grip (in 1966 they switched to a plastic key card). Possession of a Playboy Club key became a status symbol. And one of the chief attractions at the Playboy Clubs was the Bunnies. Bunnies greeted keyholders and their guests at the door. They served food and drinks, checked coats & hats, sold cigarettes and other Playboy merchandise. Whatever their position, they created a fun and welcoming atmosphere.Playboy Bunnies were in the vanguard of the sexual revolution. It goes without saying that they were beautiful, but a Bunny also had to be a cheerful \"people person.\" Bunnies worked hard, but if they were successful they could earn above-average pay and generous tips . A select few Bunnies went on to become Playboy models or even Playmates (centerfold models). Many went on to careers in diverse fields: modeling, acting, business, law, medicine, government. The same outgoing and hard-working traits that made them good Bunnies led to success at other jobs. Most also became wives and mothers. (Did you know that Jon Bon Jovi's mother was once a Playboy Bunny?)If you want to recapture that aura, get one of our bunny costumes. They're patterned after the original design worn by the actual Bunnies in the Playboy Clubs. The classic \"Bunny Suit\" was a strapless satin corset in any color. It included Bunny ears of the same fabric, black pantyhose and dyed-to-match satin pumps. All Bunnies wore a white collar with a black bow tie, white cuffs with",

Westworld is back for round two, which means the next several months will largely consist of you getting into arguments on Reddit and feeling extremely uncomfortable about Sophia the Robot's presence in your Twitter feed. But before we jump into Season 2, Episode 1, let's go over where we left off with the Season 1 finale:Dolores shot Dr. Ford at a party celebrating his final narrative. Said party was filled with Delos employees, whoops.At the same time, Maeve's robot rebellion began and the Man in Black was shot in the arm.Maeve made what appears to be her first sentient decision, opting to stay in the park to find her daughter.Teddy, Bernard, and presumably the rest of the robots are in the nascent steps of self-realization. (Remember, the order is Memory > Improvisation > Consciousness.)A note about this episode's timeline: The Season 2 premiere seems to take place during two time periods. The first is the present day; it follows Bernard hooking up with Delos' tech team, features weird flashbacks that show Dolores in modern-day garb, and ends with Bernard admitting to killing all the hosts. The second is two weeks prior, in the immediate aftermath of the board gala massacre. This is where the majority of the episode takes place.Real quick, here's a side-by-side of Bernard's differing looks between two weeks ago and present day. Why he changed outfits is unclear, but this is a helpful identifier if you ever find yourself confused about which Bernard you're watching.Left: Bernard two weeks ago; Right: Bernard present day.

    "text": "Is Princess Eugenie \"frustrated\" that she's not \"getting the attention she deserves\" for her royal work? That's the latest claim coming from a website known for its fabricated stories, but Gossip Cop can set the record straight. We're told it's \"rubbish.\"Can Nguyen/REX/ShutterstockAccording to Celeb Dirty Laundry, not a single person \"seems to be paying any attention to Eugenie\" and the \"hard work she's been putting in to help raise money for charities.\" On the other hand, purports the outlet, \"Kate Middleton [and] Meghan Markle are making headlines for their pregnancy and royal wedding plans.\" Without a single source to support its premise, the often discredited site goes on to assert that the 27-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew recently raised \"more than $600,000 for elephant and rhino charities,\" but the gala \"didn't make any headlines\" as the \"media is focusing more on Prince Harry and Markle's upcoming royal wedding\" and Middleton's third pregnancy.The outlet, which is routinely caught telling tales about the royal family, further alleges that this is \"frustrating for someone like Eugenie\" who has been \"trying so hard to be noticed in recent weeks.\" The bad blog concludes, \"For the first time in a long time, she's taking her royal duties and responsibilities very seriously.\" But Gossip Cop investigated the seemingly made-up report, and a royal source tells us the story is \"rubbish.\"Unlike CDL, Princess Eugenie understands that her cousins have a lot going on at the moment, particularly with engagements and pregnancies. Additionally, the princess has always lived relatively under-the-radar compared to Prince William and Prince Harry, and that isn't \"frustrating\" for her. The only remotely factual aspect of the entire story is that Princess Eugenie helped raise money for animal charities earlier this month, but she didn't take part in the gala just to receive media attention.",
